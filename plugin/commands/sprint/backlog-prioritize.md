# 🎯 Backlog Prioritize

AI-powered prioritization of backlog tasks.

## Criteria
1. **Vision Alignment** - How well does it align with vision?
2. **User Impact** - How many users benefit?
3. **Effort** - How much work? (inverse weight)
4. **Risk of Delay** - What's the cost of not doing it?
5. **Dependencies** - Does it unblock other work?

## Output
Reordered backlog with justification for top priorities.
