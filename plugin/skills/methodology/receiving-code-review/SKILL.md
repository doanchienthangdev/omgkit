# Receiving Code Review Skill

## Mindset
- Feedback is about code, not you
- Reviewers want to help
- Every comment is an opportunity

## Response Types

### Agree
```
Good catch! Fixed in abc123.
```

### Discuss
```
I considered that, but chose X because [reason].
What do you think about [alternative]?
```

### Clarify
```
Could you elaborate on [specific point]?
I want to make sure I understand.
```

## Process
1. Read all comments first
2. Address each comment
3. Mark resolved when fixed
4. Re-request review

## Anti-Patterns
- Defensive reactions
- Ignoring comments
- Changing without acknowledgment
