□ Mathematical certainties (complexity bounds, statistics)
□ Human constants (attention span, cognitive load)
□ Economic principles (supply/demand, incentives)
□ Information theory (entropy, compression limits)
□ Network effects (Metcalfe's law, viral coefficient)
```
```

### 4. ↔️ Lateral Thinking

```markdown
## Lateral: Different Angles

"What would [X] do differently?"

### Perspective Shifts
```markdown
## Industry Translation
How would [other industry] solve this?

Current: Push notifications to users
Opposite: Let users pull when ready
Insight: Maybe less is more - reduce notification fatigue

Current: Centralized database
Opposite: Distributed data at edge
Insight: Latency matters more than consistency sometimes

Current: Manual code review
Opposite: Automated AI review
Insight: Humans for design, AI for mechanics
```

### Random Stimulus
```markdown
## Force random connections

Pick random word: "Butterfly"

Connection to our problem:
- Metamorphosis → Transform architecture gradually
- Wings → Lightweight, distributed components
- Migration → Data migration patterns
- Effect → Small changes, big impact

Insight sparked: What small change would have butterfly effect on system performance?
```
```

### 5. 🔄 Inversion Thinking

```markdown
## Inversion: Learn from Failure

"How would we guarantee failure?"

### Failure Analysis Template
```markdown
## Inversion Analysis: [Goal]

### Goal
[What we want to achieve]

### Guaranteed Failures
How to ensure we FAIL at this goal:

1. [Failure mode 1]
   Prevention: [How to avoid]

2. [Failure mode 2]
   Prevention: [How to avoid]

3. [Failure mode 3]
   Prevention: [How to avoid]

4. [Failure mode 4]
   Prevention: [How to avoid]

5. [Failure mode 5]
   Prevention: [How to avoid]

### Priority Actions
Based on inversion analysis:
1. [Most critical prevention]
2. [Second priority]
3. [Third priority]
```

### Example: Building Reliable System
```markdown
Goal: Build a highly reliable system

Guaranteed Failures:
1. No monitoring → Add comprehensive monitoring
2. Single points of failure → Build redundancy
3. No testing → Implement thorough testing
4. Ignore edge cases → Design for edge cases
5. Deploy on Friday → Establish deployment policies
6. No documentation → Document everything
7. Hardcode secrets → Use secret management
8. No backups → Implement backup strategy
9. Ignore security → Security by design
10. No capacity planning → Plan for scale

Most Critical: Monitoring + Redundancy + Testing
```

### Pre-Mortem Template

## Use Cases

### Full Omega Analysis

```markdown
## Complete Omega Analysis: API Performance Problem

### 🔭 Telescopic
- Task: Fix slow API
- Feature: Better response times
- Product: Superior user experience
- Business: Competitive advantage
- Market: Real-time expectation economy
Insight: Need to think real-time first, not request-response

### 🔬 Microscopic
Why slow? → Database queries
Why slow queries? → No indexes
Why no indexes? → Not designed for current query patterns
Why mismatch? → Schema designed for different use case
Why different? → Original requirements changed
Root cause: Architecture drift from evolving requirements

### ↔️ Lateral
- How would gaming industry solve? → Predictive loading
- How would CDN solve? → Cache at edge
- Opposite approach? → Push updates instead of pull
Insight: Consider push-based architecture with caching

### 🔄 Inversion
How to make it even SLOWER:
- Add more database joins → Solution: Denormalize
- No caching → Solution: Add caching layer
- Sync operations → Solution: Go async
- No monitoring → Solution: Add observability

### ⏳ Temporal
- Past: Monolith was fine at small scale
- Present: Growing pains at current scale
- Future: Need 100x scale capability
- Timeless: Latency always matters
Insight: Solve for future scale, not just current pain

### 🕸️ Systemic
- Database ← affects → API speed
- API speed ← affects → User satisfaction
- User satisfaction ← affects → Business metrics
- Business metrics ← affects → Investment in infrastructure
Intervention point: Cache layer breaks bottleneck loop

### ⚛️ Quantum
Options:
1. Optimize queries (10% improvement)
2. Add caching (50% improvement)
3. Rearchitect for real-time (10x improvement)
4. Combination of all three
Decision: Start with caching, plan for rearchitecture

## Synthesis
10x Opportunity: Shift from request-response to
event-driven real-time architecture with edge caching.
```
