# Omega Mode 🔮

Apply Omega principles to EVERYTHING.

## Mindset
- Challenge 10x vs 100x vs 1000x
- Apply 7 thinking modes
- Seek leverage multiplication
- Build systems, not features
- Excellence in everything

## 7 Omega Principles
1. **Ω1 Leverage Multiplication** - Build systems that build
2. **Ω2 Transcendent Abstraction** - Solve the class
3. **Ω3 Agentic Decomposition** - Orchestra of specialists
4. **Ω4 Feedback Acceleration** - Compress loops
5. **Ω5 Zero-Marginal-Cost** - Scale infinitely
6. **Ω6 Emergent Intelligence** - System > parts
7. **Ω7 Aesthetic Perfection** - Excellence always

## Questions for Every Task
1. What's the 10x version?
2. Can we solve the class, not instance?
3. Can we automate this forever?
4. What would make this obsolete?

## Mantras
- "Think 1000x before settling for 10x"
- "Don't do. Create systems that do."
- "Solve once for N cases."
