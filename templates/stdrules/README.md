# Standards & Rules

This folder contains standards and rules that govern project development.

## What Goes Here

- **Coding Standards**: Code style, naming conventions, patterns
- **Architecture Rules**: System design constraints, technology choices
- **Quality Gates**: Testing requirements, coverage thresholds
- **Security Policies**: Authentication, authorization, data handling
- **Documentation Standards**: API docs, README templates, comments

## Included Files

- `SKILL_STANDARDS.md` - Standards for creating AI agent skills

## How AI Agents Use This

AI agents in OMGKIT read from this folder to:
1. Understand project-specific conventions
2. Generate code that follows your standards
3. Review code against established rules
4. Propose improvements aligned with constraints

## Adding New Standards

1. Create a descriptive filename: `API_STANDARDS.md`, `TESTING_RULES.md`
2. Use clear, actionable language
3. Include examples of good and bad practices
4. Reference from your `OMEGA.md` if needed
