# Development Logs

This folder contains development artifacts that are **NOT committed to git**.

## What Goes Here

- **Plans**: Implementation plans, upgrade plans, migration plans
- **Ideas**: Brainstorming notes, feature ideas, improvement proposals
- **Logs**: Development session logs, debug logs, experiment notes
- **Tracking**: Project status, task breakdowns, progress notes
- **Management**: Sprint notes, retrospectives, decision logs

## Why Separate?

- Keep repository clean from temporary development artifacts
- Allow free-form planning without polluting git history
- Separate internal notes from public documentation
- Enable AI agents to maintain persistent context

## Best Practices

1. Use descriptive filenames: `plan-auth-refactor-v2.md`
2. Date prefix for logs: `2024-12-31-session-notes.md`
3. Clean up completed plans periodically
4. Move finalized decisions to `docs/` when ready for sharing
