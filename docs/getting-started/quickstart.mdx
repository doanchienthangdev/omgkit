title: Quick Start
description: 'Build your first feature with OMGKIT in 5 minutes'
---

This guide walks you through using OMGKIT to build a feature from start to finish.

## Prerequisites

<Check>OMGKIT installed (`omgkit doctor` shows all green)</Check>
<Check>A project initialized with `omgkit init`</Check>

## Option 1: Single Command (Quick)

The fastest way to use OMGKIT is the `/feature` command:

```bash
/feature "add user authentication with email/password"
```

This triggers a full workflow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Planning">
    The **Planner** agent analyzes requirements and creates an implementation plan.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implementation">
    The **Fullstack Developer** agent writes the code.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Testing">
    The **Tester** agent generates and runs tests.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review">
    The **Code Reviewer** agent reviews for quality and security.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Commit">
    The **Git Manager** agent creates a meaningful commit.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Option 2: Sprint Management (Recommended)

For larger projects, use sprint management for organized development.

### Step 1: Set Your Vision

```bash
/vision:set
```

Claude will ask you questions about your product. Answer them, and it creates a `vision.yaml`:

```yaml
vision:
  product: "Task Management App"
  target_users: "Busy professionals"
  core_value: "Simple, fast task tracking"
  success_metrics:
    - "Users complete 80% of daily tasks"
```

### Step 2: Create a Sprint

```bash
/sprint:new "MVP Sprint" --propose
```

The AI analyzes your vision and proposes tasks:

```
Proposed Sprint Tasks:
1. [ ] User authentication (login/register)
2. [ ] Task CRUD operations
3. [ ] Task list UI with filtering
4. [ ] Due date reminders
5. [ ] Basic analytics dashboard

Accept these tasks? (yes/no/modify)
```

### Step 3: Start the Sprint

```bash
/sprint:start
```

### Step 4: Run the AI Team

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Full Auto">
    ```bash
    /team:run --mode=full-auto
    ```
    The AI team works autonomously, completing tasks one by one.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Semi Auto">
    ```bash
    /team:run --mode=semi-auto
    ```
    AI proposes actions, you approve each step.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Manual">
    ```bash
    /team:run --mode=manual
    ```
    You direct the team explicitly for each task.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Step 5: Monitor Progress

```bash
/sprint:current
```

Output:
```
Sprint: MVP Sprint
Progress: 3/5 tasks (60%)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 60%

Completed:
  ✓ User authentication
  ✓ Task CRUD operations
  ✓ Task list UI

In Progress:
  → Due date reminders (fullstack-developer working)

Remaining:
  ○ Basic analytics dashboard
```

### Step 6: End the Sprint

```bash
/sprint:end
```

Generates a retrospective with:
- Completed vs planned tasks
- Time analysis
- Lessons learned
- Recommendations for next sprint
