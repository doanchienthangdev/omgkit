## Overview

OMGKIT brings agile sprint management to AI-assisted development. Set a vision, create sprints, and let your AI team work autonomously.

## The Sprint Lifecycle

<Steps>
  <Step title="Vision">
    Define your product vision - what are you building and why?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Backlog">
    Create a prioritized list of tasks and features.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sprint Planning">
    Select tasks for the upcoming sprint.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execution">
    AI team works on tasks autonomously or with guidance.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Retrospective">
    Review what worked, what didn't, and improve.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setting Your Vision

The vision is the north star for your AI team. It guides all decisions.

```bash
/vision:set
```

Claude will ask you questions:
- What are you building?
- Who are your target users?
- What's the core value proposition?
- What does success look like?

This creates `vision.yaml`:

```yaml
vision:
  product: "Task Management App"
  tagline: "Simple task tracking for busy professionals"

  target_users:
    primary: "Busy professionals"
    secondary: "Small teams"

  core_value:
    - "Speed - add tasks in seconds"
    - "Simplicity - no learning curve"
    - "Focus - see only what matters"

  success_metrics:
    - "Users complete 80% of daily tasks"
    - "Average session under 2 minutes"
    - "NPS score above 50"

  constraints:
    - "Mobile-first design"
    - "Works offline"
    - "No account required to start"
```

View your vision:

```bash
/vision:show
```

## Managing the Backlog

Add items to your backlog:

```bash
/backlog:add "User authentication with social login"
/backlog:add "Dark mode support"
/backlog:add "Export tasks to CSV"
```

View the backlog:

```bash
/backlog:show
```

```
Product Backlog (12 items)
==========================

Priority | Task                              | Size  | Value
---------|-----------------------------------|-------|------
   1     | User authentication               | L     | High
   2     | Task CRUD operations              | M     | High
   3     | Task list UI                      | M     | High
   4     | Due date reminders                | S     | Medium
   5     | Dark mode support                 | S     | Medium
   ...
```

AI-assisted prioritization:

```bash
/backlog:prioritize
```

The Oracle agent analyzes your vision and suggests optimal ordering.

## Creating Sprints

Create a new sprint:

```bash
/sprint:new "MVP Sprint"
```

Let AI propose tasks based on vision and backlog:

```bash
/sprint:new "MVP Sprint" --propose
```

```
Sprint: MVP Sprint
Duration: 2 weeks
Start: 2024-01-15
End: 2024-01-29

Proposed Tasks:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. [ ] User authentication (email/password)
   - Agents: planner → fullstack-developer → tester
   - Estimated: 15 tasks (30-75 min total)

2. [ ] Task CRUD operations
   - Agents: api-designer → fullstack-developer → tester
   - Estimated: 12 tasks (24-60 min total)

3. [ ] Task list UI with filtering
   - Agents: ui-ux-designer → fullstack-developer → tester
   - Estimated: 10 tasks (20-50 min total)

Total: 37 tasks across 3 features

Accept? (yes/no/modify)
```

## Running the Sprint

Start the sprint:

```bash
/sprint:start
```

### Execution Modes

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Full Auto">
    ```bash
    /team:run --mode=full-auto
    ```

    The AI team works completely autonomously:
    - Picks up next task
    - Plans implementation
    - Writes code
    - Runs tests
    - Creates commits
    - Moves to next task

    **Best for**: Routine work, well-defined tasks, trusted codebase.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Semi Auto">
    ```bash
    /team:run --mode=semi-auto
    ```

    AI proposes each action, you approve:
    - "I'm about to create auth middleware. Proceed?"
    - "Tests passing. Ready to commit. Approve?"

    **Best for**: Learning, important features, reviewing AI decisions.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Manual">
    ```bash
    /team:run --mode=manual
    ```

    You direct each action:
    - "Work on task 1"
    - "Now write tests"
    - "Create commit"

    **Best for**: Complex decisions, teaching the AI your patterns.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Monitoring Progress

Check current sprint status:

```bash
/sprint:current
```

```
Sprint: MVP Sprint
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Progress: 23/37 tasks (62%)
[████████████████░░░░░░░░░░] 62%

Time: Day 5 of 14 (35% elapsed)
Velocity: Ahead of schedule

Completed Features:
  ✓ User authentication
  ✓ Task CRUD operations

In Progress:
  → Task list UI (7/10 tasks done)
    Currently: fullstack-developer implementing filters

Blocked:
  (none)

Team Activity:
  planner: idle
  fullstack-developer: active (filters component)
  tester: waiting (for filters completion)
  code-reviewer: idle
```

Check team status:

```bash
/team:status
```

Ask the team about progress:

```bash
/team:ask "what's blocking the filters feature?"
```

## Ending the Sprint

Complete the sprint:

```bash
/sprint:end
```

This generates a retrospective:

```
Sprint Retrospective: MVP Sprint
================================

Summary:
  Planned: 37 tasks
  Completed: 35 tasks (95%)
  Rolled over: 2 tasks

Velocity:
  Average: 7 tasks/day
  Peak: 12 tasks (Day 3)

What Went Well:
  - Authentication completed ahead of schedule
  - Test coverage reached 87%
  - Zero production bugs

What Didn't:
  - UI polish tasks underestimated
  - Needed more design input upfront

Recommendations for Next Sprint:
  1. Involve ui-ux-designer earlier
  2. Add buffer for UI polish
  3. Consider reducing sprint scope by 10%

Carry Over to Next Sprint:
  - [ ] Dark mode support
  - [ ] Mobile responsive fixes
```

## Shipping the Sprint

Ship the completed sprint to production in one command:

```bash
/sprint:ship "Sprint 1 - MVP Complete"
```

This command automates the full release workflow:

1. **Validate** - Check sprint status and task completion
2. **Test** - Run all tests (unless `--skip-tests`)
3. **End Sprint** - Generate retrospective and archive
4. **Commit** - Create commit with sprint summary
5. **Push** - Push to remote repository
6. **PR/Deploy** - Create PR or trigger CI/CD (unless `--no-pr`)

### Ship Options

```bash
# Skip tests (not recommended for production)
/sprint:ship "Hotfix" --skip-tests

# Push directly without PR (trunk-based development)
/sprint:ship "Sprint 1" --no-pr

# Force ship with incomplete tasks
/sprint:ship "MVP" --force
```

### Configuration

Configure ship behavior in `.omgkit/workflow.yaml`:

```yaml
ship:
  auto_test: true
  test_command: "npm test"
  create_pr: true
  pr:
    labels: ["sprint-complete"]
  commit:
    prefix: "feat(sprint)"
    include_retrospective: true
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep Tasks Small" icon="scissors">
    Break tasks into 2-5 minute units. This enables:
    - Faster feedback
    - Better progress tracking
    - Easier course correction
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Vision-Driven Development" icon="compass">
    Reference your vision in every decision. Ask:
    - Does this align with our core value?
    - Does this serve our target users?
    - Does this move our metrics?
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Regular Check-ins" icon="clock">
    Even in full-auto mode, check progress:
    - `/sprint:current` at start of day
    - `/team:status` when curious
    - `/team:ask` if something seems off
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Iterate on Process" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Use retrospectives to improve:
    - Adjust task sizing
    - Change team mode
    - Refine agent configurations
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
