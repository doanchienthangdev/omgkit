## What are Artifacts?

Artifacts are **reference documents** that provide context for AI-assisted development. They help Claude Code and OMGKIT understand your project's background, goals, and constraints.

<Note>
Artifacts are **input context** - they inform AI decisions but are NOT execution instructions.
</Note>

## Artifacts vs Other Folders

| Folder | Purpose | Git Status | AI Usage |
|--------|---------|------------|----------|
| **artifacts/** | Reference context (input) | Committed | Read for understanding |
| **devlogs/** | Development work logs | Git-ignored | Internal tracking |
| **plans/** | Formal implementation plans | Committed | Execution guidance |
| **docs/** | Generated documentation | Committed | Output documentation |

## Folder Structure

```

## How AI Uses Artifacts

When you run OMGKIT commands, the AI team will:

1. **Read artifacts** to understand project context
2. **Reference business rules** when making implementation decisions
3. **Follow naming conventions** from glossary and data dictionaries
4. **Align with requirements** in PRDs and user stories
5. **Use examples** as reference for coding patterns

## Best Practices

### 1. Keep It Organized

Create subfolders for different content types:

```
artifacts/
├── data/
│   ├── sample-users.json
│   └── schema.sql
├── docs/
│   ├── prd.md
│   └── user-stories.md
├── knowledge/
│   ├── glossary.md
│   └── business-rules.md
└── research/
    └── competitor-analysis.md
```

### 2. Use Clear Naming

- Descriptive filenames: `user-authentication-requirements.md`
- Date prefix for versioned docs: `2024-12-prd-v2.md`
- Keep extensions consistent: `.md` for markdown, `.json` for data

### 3. Keep It Relevant

- Remove outdated documents
- Update artifacts when requirements change
- Link related documents together

### 4. Don't Put Execution Work Here

Execution work belongs elsewhere:
- Implementation plans go in `plans/`
- Development logs go in `devlogs/`
- Generated docs go in `docs/`

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Copy your documents">
    Copy project documents into appropriate subfolders in `.omgkit/artifacts/`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Refresh context">
    Run `/context:index` to refresh codebase context
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start developing">
    AI will automatically reference artifacts when executing commands
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example: Setting Up Artifacts

```bash
# Create structure
mkdir -p .omgkit/artifacts/{data,docs,knowledge,research}

# Copy your PRD
cp ~/Documents/my-project-prd.md .omgkit/artifacts/docs/prd.md

# Copy sample data
cp ~/Downloads/sample-users.json .omgkit/artifacts/data/

# Create glossary
echo "# Glossary\n\n- **User**: ..." > .omgkit/artifacts/knowledge/glossary.md

# Refresh context
/context:index
```
