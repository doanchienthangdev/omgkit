# Omega Architecture Skill

## 7 Omega Principles Applied

### Ω1. Leverage Multiplication
- Build systems, not features
- Automate everything
- Create multipliers

### Ω2. Transcendent Abstraction
- Solve the class, not instance
- Find patterns behind patterns
- Build frameworks

### Ω3. Agentic Decomposition
- Specialist components
- Clear interfaces
- Autonomous operation

### Ω5. Zero-Marginal-Cost Scaling
- No per-unit cost
- Horizontal scaling
- Platform thinking

## Architecture Patterns

### Event-Driven
```
[Producer] → [Event Bus] → [Consumer]
                       → [Consumer]
                       → [Consumer]
```

### Microservices
```
[API Gateway]
     │
┌────┼────┐
▼    ▼    ▼
[A] [B]  [C]
```

### Serverless
```
[Request] → [Function] → [Database]
                      → [Queue]
                      → [Storage]
```

## Design Questions
1. How does this scale to 1000x?
2. What's the single point of failure?
3. How do we deploy without downtime?
4. What's the cost at scale?

## Configuration

You can customize skill behavior in your project config:

```yaml
# .omgkit/config.yaml
skills:
  omega-architecture:
    enabled: true
    # Add skill-specific settings here
```

## When This Skill Activates

OMGKIT detects and activates this skill when:

- You mention relevant keywords in your prompts
- Project files match the skill's domain
- Configuration files indicate this technology
- Package dependencies suggest this skill is needed

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Skill not activating">
    Ensure your project has relevant files or explicitly mention the technology in your prompt.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Unexpected patterns suggested">
    Check your project's configuration to ensure it matches your actual stack.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Missing best practices">
    Run `/index` to refresh codebase context and ensure full analysis.
