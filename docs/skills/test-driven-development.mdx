## Overview

AI agent practices test-first development with the Red-Green-Refactor cycle for confident, well-designed code. Use when implementing features, fixing bugs, or establishing testing practices.

# Developing Test-Driven

## Quick Start

1. **Red** - Write a failing test that defines desired behavior
2. **Green** - Write minimal code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor** - Improve code while keeping tests green
4. **Repeat** - Continue with next behavior (1-5 minute cycles)

## Features

| Feature | Description | Guide |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Red-Green-Refactor | Core TDD cycle | Fail -> Pass -> Improve -> Repeat |
| Test Patterns | Effective test structures | Arrange-Act-Assert, Given-When-Then |
| Test Fixtures | Reusable test setup | beforeEach, factories, builders |
| Mocking Strategies | Isolate dependencies | Inject deps, mock boundaries only |
| Parameterized Tests | Test multiple inputs | `it.each` for input variations |
| Coverage Analysis | Verify thoroughness | Statements, branches, functions |

## Common Patterns

```typescript
// RED-GREEN-REFACTOR CYCLE

// RED: Write failing test
it('rejects passwords shorter than 8 characters', () => {
  const result = validatePassword('short');
  expect(result.valid).toBe(false);
  expect(result.errors).toContain('Password must be at least 8 characters');
});

// GREEN: Minimal implementation
function validatePassword(password: string) {
  const errors = [];
  if (password.length < 8) {
    errors.push('Password must be at least 8 characters');
  }
  return { valid: errors.length === 0, errors };
}

// REFACTOR: Extract rules (tests stay green)
const rules = [
  { test: (p) => p.length >= 8, message: 'Must be 8+ chars' },
  { test: (p) => /[A-Z]/.test(p), message: 'Must have uppercase' },
];
function validatePassword(password: string) {
  const errors = rules.filter(r => !r.test(password)).map(r => r.message);
  return { valid: errors.length === 0, errors };
}
```

```typescript
// ARRANGE-ACT-ASSERT Pattern
it('increases total when item added', () => {
  // ARRANGE
  const cart = new ShoppingCart();
  const item = { id: '1', price: 10.00 };

  // ACT
  cart.addItem(item);

  // ASSERT
  expect(cart.total).toBe(10.00);
});

// PARAMETERIZED TESTS
it.each([
  ['simple@example.com', true],
  ['user.name@domain.org', true],
  ['invalid', false],
  ['@nodomain.com', false],
])('validates %s as %s', (email, expected) => {
  expect(isValidEmail(email)).toBe(expected);
});

// BUILDER PATTERN for test data
const user = new UserBuilder().admin().inactive().build();
```

```
# Mocking Guidelines
MOCK (external boundaries):
- External APIs (payment, email)
- Third-party services
- System clock, random
- Network requests

DON'T MOCK (your code):
- Pure functions
- Data transformations
- Business logic
- Internal services
```

```
# Coverage Analysis
| Type | Target | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Statements | 80%+ | Code executed |
| Branches | 70%+ | If/else paths |
| Functions | 90%+ | All functions called |

REMEMBER: 100% coverage != well-tested
- Test edge cases
- Test error paths
- Test boundary conditions
```

## Best Practices

| Do | Avoid |
|----|-------|
| Write test BEFORE implementation | Writing implementation first |
| Keep tests focused on ONE behavior | Testing multiple things in one test |
| Use descriptive test names | Generic names like "test1" |
| Run tests frequently (every few minutes) | Long gaps between test runs |
| Refactor only when tests green | Refactoring with failing tests |
| Test behavior, not implementation | Testing private methods directly |
| Keep cycles short (1-5 minutes) | 30+ minute cycles |
| Mock only external dependencies | Over-mocking your own code |

skills:
  test-driven-development:
    enabled: true
    # Add skill-specific settings here
```
