# Avoiding Testing Anti-Patterns

## Quick Start

1. **Identify** - Recognize anti-pattern category (flaky, implementation, over-mocking)
2. **Assess Severity** - Critical (fix now), High (fix soon), Medium (plan to fix)
3. **Apply Fix** - Use proper async handling, test behavior not implementation
4. **Verify** - Run tests in random order, ensure independence
5. **Prevent** - Add test smell detection to CI

## Features

| Feature | Description | Guide |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Flaky Tests | Random failures destroying trust | Use waitFor, not sleep; deterministic data |
| Implementation Testing | Breaks on every refactor | Test behavior through public interface |
| Over-Mocking | Tests pass but bugs slip through | Mock boundaries only, not your own code |
| Slow Tests | Hurt development velocity | Right test layer, shared setup, mock network |
| Test Interdependence | Can't run tests in isolation | Fresh state in beforeEach, no shared mutation |
| Poor Design | Hard to understand/maintain | Descriptive names, focused tests, clear values |

## Common Patterns

```typescript
// FLAKY: Timing-dependent
await sleep(100);  // May not be enough
expect(result).toBe('processed');

// FIXED: Wait for condition
await waitFor(() => {
  expect(result).toBe('processed');
}, { timeout: 5000 });

// FLAKY: Shared state between tests
let sharedState = [];
it('test1', () => { sharedState.push('a'); });
it('test2', () => { expect(sharedState).toHaveLength(1); }); // Order-dependent!

// FIXED: Fresh state each test
beforeEach(() => { sharedState = []; });

// IMPLEMENTATION: Testing private state
expect(counter._count).toBe(1);

// BEHAVIOR: Testing public interface
expect(counter.getValue()).toBe(1);

// OVER-MOCKING: Everything mocked
const mockDb = { save: jest.fn() };
const mockPayment = { charge: jest.fn() };
// Only testing that mocks were called

// FIXED: Mock boundaries only
const testDb = await createTestDatabase();  // Real
const mockPayment = createMockPaymentProvider();  // External only
```

```
# Anti-Pattern Severity Guide
CRITICAL (fix immediately):
- Flaky tests - Random failures destroy trust
- Testing implementation - Breaks on every refactor
- Hidden dependencies - Tests fail mysteriously

HIGH (fix soon):
- Slow tests - Hurt development velocity
- Test interdependence - Can't run in isolation
- Over-mocking - Tests pass but bugs slip through

MEDIUM (plan to fix):
- Poor naming - Tests don't document behavior
- Magic values - Unclear expected values
- Giant tests - Hard to understand

LOW (fix when touching):
- Commented tests - Remove or fix
- Duplicate tests - Consolidate
```

## Best Practices

| Do | Avoid |
|----|-------|
| Test behavior, not implementation | Accessing private properties |
| Use factories for test data | Random/inconsistent test data |
| Write descriptive test names | Generic names like "test1", "should work" |
| Keep tests independent | Shared mutable state between tests |
| Mock only external boundaries | Mocking your own code extensively |
| Use waitFor, not sleep | setTimeout/sleep in tests |
| Make assertions specific | toBeDefined() for everything |
| Run tests in random order | Assuming test execution order |
