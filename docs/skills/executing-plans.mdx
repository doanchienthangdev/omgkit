## Overview

Executing implementation plans. Use when implementing from a plan.

## What You Get

When this skill is active, agents automatically apply:

<Check>Industry best practices and patterns</Check>
<Check>Production-ready code examples</Check>
<Check>Security considerations</Check>

# Executing Plans Skill

## Process
1. Read the plan completely
2. Verify understanding
3. Execute tasks in order
4. Check off completed tasks
5. Report blockers immediately
