## How Skills Work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Auto-Detection">
    OMGKIT scans your project for configuration files, dependencies, and file extensions to identify technologies.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Skill Loading">
    Relevant skills are automatically loaded, providing agents with domain expertise.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Best Practices Applied">
    Agents apply idiomatic patterns, security best practices, and performance optimizations.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example: Next.js Project

When working on a Next.js project, OMGKIT automatically loads:

| Skill | Provides |
|-------|----------|
| **Next.js** | App Router patterns, Server Components, API routes |
| **React** | Component patterns, hooks, state management |
| **TypeScript** | Type safety, interfaces, generics |
| **Tailwind CSS** | Utility classes, responsive design |
