# Omega Thinking Skill

## The 7 Modes

### 🔭 TELESCOPIC
Zoom out to see the big picture.
- Task → Feature → Product → Market → Industry → World
- **Ask**: "What's the ultimate impact?"

### 🔬 MICROSCOPIC
First principles analysis.
- Why? → Why? → Why? → Why? → Why?
- **Ask**: "What's fundamentally true?"

### ↔️ LATERAL
Different angles and approaches.
- How would [X industry] solve this?
- What's the opposite approach?
- **Ask**: "What are we not seeing?"

### 🔄 INVERSION
Learn through failure.
- How to guarantee failure?
- Avoid those things.
- **Ask**: "What would make this fail?"

### ⏳ TEMPORAL
Time dimension analysis.
- Historical patterns?
- Relevant in 10 years?
- **Ask**: "How does time affect this?"

### 🕸️ SYSTEMIC
Interconnections and emergence.
- Components and connections?
- Feedback loops?
- **Ask**: "What system dynamics are at play?"

### ⚛️ QUANTUM
Multiple possibilities.
- All possible solutions?
- How to test quickly?
- **Ask**: "What are all the possibilities?"

## Application
For any problem:
1. Apply all 7 modes
2. Synthesize insights
3. Find the 10x opportunity

## Configuration
