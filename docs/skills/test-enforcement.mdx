# Test Enforcement

## Overview

This skill defines the enforcement rules and mechanisms that ensure tests are written, executed, and passing before any implementation work can be considered complete. It provides a framework for blocking premature completion and requiring evidence of test coverage.

## Core Principle

**No code is "done" without tests.**

```
Definition of Done:
├── Code implemented ✓
├── Tests written ✓
├── Tests passing ✓
├── Coverage met ✓
├── Review approved ✓
└── THEN → Done
```

## Enforcement Levels

### Level 1: Soft Enforcement (Warning)
- Warn when completing without tests
- Allow override with justification
- Log for retrospective

### Level 2: Standard Enforcement (Default)
- Block completion without tests
- Require minimum coverage
- Allow emergency override with approval

### Level 3: Strict Enforcement (Critical Systems)
- Block all completion without full test suite
- Require coverage above target
- No overrides allowed

## Configuration

```yaml
# .omgkit/workflow.yaml
testing:
  enforcement:
    level: standard  # soft | standard | strict

  requirements:
    unit_tests: required
    integration_tests: required
    e2e_tests: optional
    security_tests: conditional  # Required for auth features

  coverage_gates:
    unit:
      minimum: 80
      target: 90
      block_below: 70
    integration:
      minimum: 60
      target: 75
      block_below: 50
    overall:
      minimum: 75
      target: 85

  blocking:
    on_test_failure: true
    on_coverage_below_minimum: true
    on_missing_test_types: true

  overrides:
    allow_emergency: true
    require_approval: true
    log_all_overrides: true
```

## Pre-Completion Checklist

### Mandatory Checks (Cannot Override)

```markdown
## Blocking Criteria

- [ ] **Tests Exist**: At least one test file for changed code
- [ ] **Tests Execute**: All tests run without errors
- [ ] **Tests Pass**: Zero failing tests
- [ ] **No Skipped Critical**: No skipped tests for critical paths
```

### Standard Checks (Override with Approval)

```markdown
## Standard Criteria

- [ ] **Unit Coverage**: ≥80% line coverage
- [ ] **Branch Coverage**: ≥70% branch coverage
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Present for API/DB changes
- [ ] **No Flaky Tests**: Tests deterministic
- [ ] **Test Isolation**: No test interdependencies
```

### Quality Checks (Override with Justification)

```markdown
## Quality Criteria

- [ ] **Mutation Score**: ≥60% mutations killed
- [ ] **Performance Tests**: Present for perf-critical code
- [ ] **Security Tests**: Present for auth/input handling
- [ ] **E2E Tests**: Present for user-facing features
```

## Enforcement Workflow

### 1. Task Completion Attempt

```
Developer: "Mark TASK-042 as done"

System Check:
├── Has tests? → Yes
├── Tests passing? → Yes
├── Coverage ≥ 80%? → 75% (FAIL)
└── Block completion

Response: "Cannot mark as done. Coverage is 75%, minimum is 80%.
          Add tests for uncovered lines: src/handlers/user.ts:45-52"
```

### 2. Override Request

```
Developer: "Override coverage requirement"

System Check:
├── Enforcement level? → Standard
├── Override allowed? → Yes, with approval
├── Approval required? → Yes
└── Request approval

Response: "Override requested. Waiting for approval from:
          - Tech Lead
          - QA Lead
          Justification required."
```

### 3. Emergency Override

```
Developer: "Emergency override - production hotfix"

System Check:
├── Emergency flag? → Yes
├── Emergency override allowed? → Yes
├── Logging? → Enabled
└── Grant temporary override

Response: "Emergency override granted.
          ⚠️ This is logged and will be reviewed.
          ⚠️ Tests must be added within 24 hours.
          ⚠️ Follow-up task created: TASK-043 Add tests for hotfix"
```

## Evidence Requirements

### Test Execution Evidence

```markdown
## Required Evidence

### Test Report
- Total tests: 42
- Passed: 42
- Failed: 0
- Skipped: 0
- Duration: 3.2s

### Coverage Report
| File | Lines | Branches | Functions |
|------|-------|----------|-----------|
| user.ts | 92% | 85% | 100% |
| auth.ts | 88% | 80% | 95% |
| **Total** | **90%** | **82%** | **97%** |

### Attached Artifacts
- [ ] test-report.json
- [ ] coverage/lcov.info
- [ ] screenshots/ (for E2E)
```

### Approval Evidence (for Overrides)

```markdown
## Override Approval

**Requested by:** developer@team.com
**Approved by:** techlead@team.com
**Reason:** Legacy code refactor - tests will be added in TASK-044
**Follow-up:** TASK-044 due in 3 days
**Logged at:** 2024-01-06T14:30:00Z
```

## Integration Points

### 1. Todo List Integration

```
Before enforcement:
- [ ] TASK-042: Implement user endpoint
- [ ] TEST-042: Add tests for user endpoint

After attempting completion without tests:
- [x] TASK-042: Implement user endpoint
- [ ] TEST-042: Add tests for user endpoint ⚠️ BLOCKING

Status: Feature blocked until TEST-042 complete
```

### 2. Git Hook Integration

```bash
# pre-push hook
#!/bin/bash

echo "Running test enforcement checks..."

# Run tests
npm test
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ Tests failing. Push blocked."
  exit 1
fi

# Check coverage
coverage=$(npm run coverage:check --silent)
if [ $coverage -lt 80 ]; then
  echo "❌ Coverage $coverage% below minimum 80%. Push blocked."
  exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Test enforcement passed."
```

### 3. PR Integration

```yaml
# GitHub Actions check
name: Test Enforcement
on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  enforce-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Check Coverage
        run: |
          coverage=$(npm run coverage:json | jq '.total.lines.pct')
          if (( $(echo "$coverage < 80" | bc -l) )); then
            echo "Coverage $coverage% below minimum"
            exit 1
          fi

      - name: Verify Test Types
        run: |
          if [ ! -f "tests/unit/*.test.ts" ]; then
            echo "Missing unit tests"
            exit 1
          fi
```

## Enforcement Messages

### Blocking Messages

```
❌ COMPLETION BLOCKED: Tests Required

Your task cannot be marked as done because:
• No test files found for changed code
• Add tests to: tests/unit/user.test.ts

Run: /quality:verify-done for detailed requirements
```

```
❌ COMPLETION BLOCKED: Coverage Below Minimum

Your task cannot be marked as done because:
• Current coverage: 72%
• Minimum required: 80%

Uncovered lines:
• src/handlers/user.ts: lines 45-52, 78-82
• src/services/auth.ts: lines 23-25

Run: npm run test:coverage for detailed report
```

### Warning Messages

```
⚠️ WARNING: Optional Tests Missing

Your task can be completed, but consider adding:
• Performance tests (recommended for API endpoints)
• Security tests (recommended for auth handling)

These tests improve code quality and catch issues early.
```

### Success Messages

```
✅ TEST ENFORCEMENT PASSED

All requirements met:
• Tests exist: ✓
• Tests passing: ✓ (42/42)
• Coverage: ✓ (92%)
• No skipped: ✓

Task can be marked as done.
```

## Override Procedures

### Standard Override

1. Request override with justification
2. Wait for approval (Tech Lead or QA)
3. Document reason in task
4. Create follow-up task for tests
5. Complete original task

### Emergency Override

1. Flag as emergency
2. System grants temporary override
3. Complete task
4. Follow-up task auto-created
5. Must add tests within SLA (24-48 hours)

### Override Audit

All overrides are logged:
```json
{
  "task_id": "TASK-042",
  "override_type": "coverage",
  "requested_by": "developer@team.com",
  "approved_by": "techlead@team.com",
  "reason": "Legacy code, tests in follow-up",
  "follow_up_task": "TASK-043",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-06T14:30:00Z",
  "enforcement_level": "standard"
}
```

## Metrics and Reporting

### Enforcement Metrics

```
Weekly Report:
├── Tasks completed: 42
├── With tests: 40 (95%)
├── Overrides used: 2 (5%)
│   ├── Emergency: 1
│   └── Approved: 1
├── Average coverage: 87%
└── Test-first tasks: 15 (36%)
```

### Coverage Trends

```
Coverage Trend (Last 4 Weeks):
Week 1: 78% ████████
Week 2: 82% █████████
Week 3: 85% █████████
Week 4: 87% █████████
Target:  90% ██████████
```

## Best Practices

### DO
- Set realistic coverage minimums
- Allow emergency overrides for hotfixes
- Create follow-up tasks for overrides
- Review override patterns in retrospectives
- Celebrate test-first development

### DON'T
- Set coverage targets too high initially
- Block all overrides (causes workarounds)
- Skip enforcement for "simple" changes
- Ignore flaky test patterns
- Punish developers for using overrides appropriately

## Escalation Path

```
Coverage below minimum
    ↓
Request override
    ↓
Tech Lead approval required
    ↓
If denied → Add tests
    ↓
If approved → Create follow-up task
    ↓
Complete with documented override
```
