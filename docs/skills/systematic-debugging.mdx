## Overview

Systematic debugging process. Use when investigating bugs.

## What You Get

When this skill is active, agents automatically apply:

<Check>Industry best practices and patterns</Check>
<Check>Production-ready code examples</Check>
<Check>Security considerations</Check>
<Check>Performance optimizations</Check>
<Check>Comprehensive error handling</Check>

# Systematic Debugging Skill

## Process

### 1. Reproduce
- Can you reproduce consistently?
- What are the exact steps?
- What environment?

### 2. Isolate
- What's the smallest case?
- Which component fails?
- When did it start?

### 3. Hypothesize
Form 3 hypotheses:
1. [Most likely cause]
2. [Second possibility]
3. [Unlikely but possible]

### 4. Test
- Test each hypothesis
- Use binary search for large codebases
- Add logging strategically

### 5. Fix
- Minimal fix first
- Add regression test
- Verify fix works

## Tools
```bash
git bisect start
git bisect bad HEAD
git bisect good v1.0.0
```

## Output
```markdown
## Debug Report
- Problem: [Description]
- Root Cause: [Actual cause]
- Fix: [What changed]
- Prevention: [How to prevent]
```

## Configuration

You can customize skill behavior in your project config:

```yaml
# .omgkit/config.yaml
skills:
  systematic-debugging:
    enabled: true
    # Add skill-specific settings here
```

## When This Skill Activates

OMGKIT detects and activates this skill when:

- You mention relevant keywords in your prompts
- Project files match the skill's domain
- Configuration files indicate this technology
- Package dependencies suggest this skill is needed

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Skill not activating">
    Ensure your project has relevant files or explicitly mention the technology in your prompt.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Unexpected patterns suggested">
    Check your project's configuration to ensure it matches your actual stack.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Missing best practices">
    Run `/index` to refresh codebase context and ensure full analysis.
