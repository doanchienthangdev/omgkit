# Requesting Code Reviews

## Quick Start

1. **Self-Review** - Review your own diff first, catch obvious issues
2. **Prepare Code** - Tests pass, no debug code, documentation updated
3. **Write Description** - Clear summary, changes list, testing info, screenshots
4. **Select Reviewers** - Match expertise to changes, respect workload
5. **Time Appropriately** - Early week, morning hours, avoid Fridays

## Features

| Feature | Description | Guide |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Self-Review | Catch issues before requesting | Check debug code, TODOs, test coverage |
| PR Description | Guide reviewers effectively | Summary, changes, testing, attention areas |
| Reviewer Selection | Match expertise to needs | Code owner, domain expert, security reviewer |
| PR Sizing | Optimal size for review quality | <400 lines ideal, split larger PRs |
| Timing | When to request reviews | Morning, early week, check availability |
| Reviewer Guidance | Help reviewers focus | Key areas, skip suggestions, questions |

## Common Patterns

```
# PR Description Template
## Summary
[What changed and why - 2-3 sentences]
Resolves #123

## Changes
- [Bullet point each significant change]

## Testing
### Automated Tests
- [x] Unit tests added/updated
- [x] Integration tests pass

### Manual Testing
1. [Step to verify]
2. [Expected result]

## Screenshots
[For UI changes]

## Areas Needing Review
- Security: [specific file/concern]
- Performance: [specific concern]

## Checklist
- [x] Self-review completed
- [x] Tests pass locally
- [x] Documentation updated
```

```
# PR Size Guide
| Size | Lines | Review Time | Recommendation |
|------|-------|-------------|----------------|
| Small | <100 | 15-30 min | Ideal for quality review |
| Medium | <400 | 30-60 min | Acceptable |
| Large | <800 | 1-2 hours | Consider splitting |
| Too Large | 800+ | 2+ hours | Split required |

# Reviewer Selection
1. Code owner - maintains affected area
2. Domain expert - knows the technology
3. Security - for auth/crypto changes
4. Architecture - for design changes

Max reviewers: 4 (too many = diffused responsibility)
```

```
# Self-Review Checklist
[ ] No console.log/debug statements
[ ] No commented-out code
[ ] No hardcoded values (should be config)
[ ] Error handling appropriate
[ ] All tests pass
[ ] New code has tests
[ ] Complex logic has comments
[ ] Commit messages clear
[ ] Rebased on latest main
```

## Best Practices

| Do | Avoid |
|----|-------|
| Self-review first | Submitting PRs without testing |
| Keep PRs small (<400 lines) | Creating massive PRs |
| Write clear descriptions | Leaving descriptions empty |
| Highlight key review areas | Expecting reviewers to find everything |
| Choose reviewers wisely | Overloading single reviewers |
| Be responsive to feedback | Ignoring reviewer availability |
| Include screenshots for UI | Rushing reviewers |
| Test thoroughly first | Wasting reviewer time on broken code |
