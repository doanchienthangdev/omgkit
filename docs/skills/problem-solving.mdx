# Solving Problems

## Purpose

Apply a systematic 5-phase framework for complex problems:

- Define problem boundaries clearly before investigating
- Generate multiple hypotheses before testing any
- Test hypotheses efficiently with time-boxing
- Fix root causes, not just symptoms
- Prevent recurrence with process improvements

## Quick Start

1. **Define** (5-10 min) - Clarify what IS and IS NOT the problem, set success criteria
2. **Hypothesize** (10-15 min) - Generate 3+ hypotheses BEFORE testing any
3. **Test** (time-boxed) - Test cheapest hypothesis first, mark confirmed/eliminated
4. **Solve** - Fix root cause, verify fix, add regression test
5. **Prevent** - Analyze why it happened, implement preventive measures

## Features

| Feature | Description | Guide |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Problem Boundary | Define what IS vs IS NOT the problem | List symptoms, affected scope, working parts |
| Hypothesis Generation | Create 3+ theories before testing | Include evidence for/against, test cost |
| Prioritized Testing | Test highest-value hypotheses first | Score = evidence x (1/cost) |
| Root Cause Fix | Address underlying cause, not symptoms | Verify fix prevents recurrence |
| Prevention Plan | Stop future occurrences | Code, process, monitoring changes |
| Escalation Criteria | Know when to ask for help | Time-boxed out, all hypotheses eliminated |

## Common Patterns

```
# Define Phase
BOUNDARY DEFINITION
What IS the problem:
- Specific error: [error message]
- Steps to reproduce: [steps]
- When started: [date/commit]

What is NOT the problem:
- What still works: [list]
- Red herrings eliminated: [list]

Success criteria:
- What does "solved" look like?

# Hypothesize Phase
H1: [Most likely] - Evidence: ___ - Test cost: Low
H2: [Second likely] - Evidence: ___ - Test cost: Medium
H3: [Less likely] - Evidence: ___ - Test cost: High

RULE: Generate hypotheses BEFORE testing any.

# Test Phase
Test H1: [15 min box]
  Action: ___
  Result: CONFIRMED / ELIMINATED / INCONCLUSIVE
```

```
# Risk Assessment Matrix
| Hypothesis | Probability | Impact | Test Effort | Priority |
|------------|-------------|--------|-------------|----------|
| H1         | High        | High   | Low         | 1st      |
| H2         | Medium      | High   | Medium      | 2nd      |
```

## Use Cases

- Debugging complex bugs when conventional approaches fail
- Troubleshooting production incidents with unknown root causes
- Analyzing intermittent failures or race conditions
- Investigating performance regressions
- Resolving integration issues between systems

## Best Practices

| Do | Avoid |
|----|-------|
| Generate multiple hypotheses before testing | Testing first idea that comes to mind |
| Test cheapest hypothesis first when evidence equal | Spending 4 hours on 1 hypothesis |
| Time-box each phase | Rabbit holes without progress |
| Document failed approaches (valuable data) | Discarding hypotheses without testing |
| Verify root cause, not just symptoms | Fixing symptoms without understanding cause |
| Escalate when time-boxed out | Hero-coding beyond time limits |
| Add regression tests for every fix | Skipping prevention phase |
