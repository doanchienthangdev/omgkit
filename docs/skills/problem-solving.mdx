# Problem Solving

A **systematic 5-phase framework** for tackling complex problems when conventional approaches fail. This skill provides structured methods to break through blockers and find solutions efficiently.

## Purpose

When you're stuck, random attempts waste time and energy. This skill provides:

- Structured approach to unknown problems
- Multiple hypothesis generation
- Systematic elimination process
- Time-boxed investigation phases
- Clear escalation criteria

## The 5-Phase Framework

### Phase 1: Define (5-10 minutes)
```
BOUNDARY DEFINITION
==================
What IS the problem:
- [ ] Specific error/behavior observed
- [ ] Exact steps to reproduce
- [ ] When it started occurring
- [ ] Affected scope (users, features, environments)

What is NOT the problem:
- [ ] What still works correctly
- [ ] Unrelated symptoms
- [ ] Red herrings already eliminated

Success criteria:
- [ ] What does "solved" look like?
- [ ] How will we verify the fix?
```

### Phase 2: Hypothesize (10-15 minutes)
```
HYPOTHESIS GENERATION (minimum 3)
================================
H1: [Most likely] ________________________
    Evidence for: ________________________
    Evidence against: ____________________
    Test cost: Low / Medium / High

H2: [Second likely] ______________________
    Evidence for: ________________________
    Evidence against: ____________________
    Test cost: Low / Medium / High

H3: [Unlikely but possible] ______________
    Evidence for: ________________________
    Evidence against: ____________________
    Test cost: Low / Medium / High

RULE: Generate hypotheses BEFORE testing any of them.
```

### Phase 3: Test (Time-boxed per hypothesis)
```
HYPOTHESIS TESTING ORDER
========================
Sort by: (Evidence strength) × (1 / Test cost)

Test H1: [15 min box]
  Action: ________________________________
  Result: CONFIRMED / ELIMINATED / INCONCLUSIVE
  If inconclusive: Need more data on __________

Test H2: [15 min box]
  Action: ________________________________
  Result: CONFIRMED / ELIMINATED / INCONCLUSIVE

STOP when: Hypothesis confirmed OR all eliminated
```

### Phase 4: Solve (Implementation)
```
SOLUTION IMPLEMENTATION
=======================
Root cause: ______________________________
Solution approach: _______________________

Implementation checklist:
- [ ] Write the fix
- [ ] Verify fix addresses root cause (not symptom)
- [ ] Check for side effects
- [ ] Add test to prevent regression
- [ ] Document the issue and solution
```

### Phase 5: Prevent (Post-mortem)
```
PREVENTION ANALYSIS
===================
Why did this happen?
- Immediate cause: _______________________
- Contributing factors: __________________
- Systemic issues: _______________________

How do we prevent recurrence?
- [ ] Code changes
- [ ] Process changes
- [ ] Monitoring/alerting
- [ ] Documentation updates
```

## Features

### 1. Root Cause Hypothesis Generator
```javascript
// Common hypothesis categories for software issues:

const hypothesisCategories = {
  data: [
    "Invalid input data",
    "Data corruption",
    "Missing required data",
    "Encoding/format mismatch",
    "Stale/cached data"
  ],
  configuration: [
    "Environment variable missing",
    "Config file incorrect",
    "Feature flag state",
    "Permission misconfiguration",
    "Version mismatch"
  ],
  timing: [
    "Race condition",
    "Timeout too short",
    "Order of operations",
    "Async/await issue",
    "Deadlock"
  ],
  resources: [
    "Memory exhaustion",
    "Disk space",
    "Connection pool depleted",
    "Rate limiting",
    "CPU throttling"
  ],
  external: [
    "Third-party service down",
    "Network connectivity",
    "DNS resolution",
    "Certificate expiry",
    "API contract change"
  ]
};
```

### 2. Decision Tree Construction
```
START: Error occurs
  |
  +-- Is it reproducible?
  |     |
  |     +-- YES: Proceed to isolation
  |     |
  |     +-- NO: Focus on logging/monitoring
  |           |
  |           +-- Add debug logging
  |           +-- Wait for recurrence
  |           +-- Analyze patterns
  |
  +-- Can you isolate the component?
        |
        +-- YES: Deep dive that component
        |
        +-- NO: Binary search approach
              |
              +-- Disable half the system
              +-- Does error persist?
              +-- Narrow down iteratively
```

### 3. Risk Assessment Matrix
```
| Hypothesis | Probability | Impact | Test Effort | Priority |
|------------|-------------|--------|-------------|----------|
| H1         | High        | High   | Low         | 1st      |
| H2         | Medium      | High   | Medium      | 2nd      |
| H3         | Low         | High   | Low         | 3rd      |
| H4         | High        | Low    | High        | 4th      |
```

### 4. Time-Boxing Templates
```
INVESTIGATION TIME BOX: 2 hours total

Phase 1 (Define):      15 min  [■■■□□□□□□□□□]
Phase 2 (Hypothesize): 15 min  [■■■□□□□□□□□□]
Phase 3 (Test):        60 min  [■■■■■■■■■■■■]
Phase 4 (Solve):       20 min  [■■■■□□□□□□□□]
Phase 5 (Prevent):     10 min  [■■□□□□□□□□□□]

ESCALATION TRIGGER: If no progress after Phase 3, escalate.
```

## Use Cases

### Stuck on Implementation
```
PROBLEM: Feature works locally but fails in staging

Phase 1 - Define:
  - Works: Local dev environment
  - Fails: Staging environment
  - Error: "Connection refused to service X"
  - Started: After last deployment

Phase 2 - Hypothesize:
  H1: Environment variable not set in staging
  H2: Network policy blocking connection
  H3: Service X not deployed to staging
  H4: Different service discovery mechanism

Phase 3 - Test:
  H1 Test: Check env vars → MISSING API_URL! ✓ CONFIRMED

Phase 4 - Solve:
  - Add API_URL to staging config
  - Verify connection works
  - Add config validation on startup

Phase 5 - Prevent:
  - Add env var validation script to CI
  - Document all required env vars
```

### Performance Bottleneck
```
PROBLEM: API response time degraded from 100ms to 2s

Phase 1 - Define:
  - Specific: GET /api/users endpoint
  - Started: Monday after deployment
  - Scope: All users, all requests

Phase 2 - Hypothesize:
  H1: N+1 query introduced
  H2: Missing database index
  H3: External API slowdown
  H4: Resource contention

Phase 3 - Test:
  H1: Query count check → 1 query, not N+1
  H2: EXPLAIN ANALYZE → Full table scan! ✓ CONFIRMED

Phase 4 - Solve:
  - Add index on users.organization_id
  - Response time: 2s → 50ms

Phase 5 - Prevent:
  - Add query performance tests
  - Require EXPLAIN for new queries in PR review
```

### Integration Failures
```
PROBLEM: Webhook deliveries failing intermittently

Phase 1 - Define:
  - Failure rate: ~5% of webhooks
  - No pattern in time/endpoint
  - Error: Timeout after 30s
  - Started: Gradual increase over 2 weeks

Phase 2 - Hypothesize:
  H1: Receiving servers slow
  H2: Our server resource exhaustion
  H3: Network issues
  H4: Payload size growth

Phase 3 - Test:
  H1: Check receiving server logs → Mixed results
  H2: Monitor our CPU/memory → Normal
  H3: Network packet loss test → Normal
  H4: Analyze payload sizes → 10x increase! ✓ CONFIRMED

Phase 4 - Solve:
  - Compress payloads
  - Increase timeout for large payloads
  - Add pagination for large datasets

Phase 5 - Prevent:
  - Add payload size monitoring
  - Set alerts for size thresholds
```

## Best Practices

### Do's
- **Generate multiple hypotheses** before testing any
- **Test cheapest hypothesis first** when evidence is equal
- **Time-box each phase** to prevent rabbit holes
- **Document failed approaches** - they're valuable data
- **Escalate when time-boxed out** - don't hero-code

### Don'ts
- Don't test the first idea that comes to mind
- Don't spend 4 hours on 1 hypothesis
- Don't discard hypotheses without testing
- Don't fix symptoms without understanding root cause
- Don't skip the prevention phase

### Escalation Criteria
```
ESCALATE WHEN:
- [ ] Time box exceeded with no progress
- [ ] All hypotheses eliminated but problem persists
- [ ] Problem scope larger than initially understood
- [ ] Required access/knowledge not available
- [ ] Business impact exceeds threshold

ESCALATION FORMAT:
"I've investigated [problem] for [time].
 Tested hypotheses: [H1, H2, H3]
 Current status: [findings]
 Blocker: [what's needed]
 Ask: [specific help needed]"
```
