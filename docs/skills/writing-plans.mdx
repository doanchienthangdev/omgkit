# Writing Plans

## Quick Start

1. **Summarize** - Executive summary with goals, non-goals, background
2. **Design** - High-level approach, architecture diagram, key decisions
3. **Break Down** - Tasks in 2-4 hour chunks with file locations
4. **Map Dependencies** - Identify critical path and parallel opportunities
5. **Assess Risks** - Likelihood x Impact matrix with mitigations
6. **Estimate** - Three-point estimation with buffers

## Features

| Feature | Description | Guide |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Plan Structure | Comprehensive template | Summary, design, tasks, testing, risks |
| Task Breakdown | Manageable work units | 2-4 hours, single owner, clear criteria |
| Dependency Mapping | Sequence and parallelize | Critical path, hard/soft dependencies |
| Risk Assessment | Anticipate problems | Likelihood x Impact matrix |
| Effort Estimation | Realistic timing | Three-point: (O + 4M + P) / 6 |
| File-Level Detail | Exact code locations | New files, modifications, line numbers |

## Common Patterns

```
# Plan Structure
# Plan: [Feature Name]

## Metadata
- Status: Draft | Approved | In Progress
- Estimated Duration: [X days]
- Priority: P0 | P1 | P2

## Goals & Non-Goals
Goals: [What this WILL accomplish]
Non-Goals: [What this will NOT address]

## Design Overview
[High-level approach, architecture diagram]

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: [Foundation] - [X days]
#### Task 1.1: [Name]
- Description: [What]
- Estimate: [X hours]
- Files: `src/file.ts:45-60`
- Dependencies: None
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - [ ] [Criterion 1]
  - [ ] [Criterion 2]

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| [Risk] | High | High | [Strategy] |
```

```
# Dependency Diagram
           [START]
              |
   +----------+----------+
   |          |          |
[Task 1]  [Task 2]  [Task 3]  <- Parallel
   |          |          |
   +-----+----+          |
         |               |
      [Task 4]      [Task 5]
         |               |
         +-------+-------+
                 |
            [Task 6]      <- Integration
                 |
            [COMPLETE]

Critical Path: 1 -> 4 -> 6 (determines min duration)
```

```
# Effort Estimation
Three-Point: (Optimistic + 4*MostLikely + Pessimistic) / 6

Example - OAuth Implementation:
- Optimistic: 4 hours (works first try)
- Most Likely: 8 hours (normal dev)
- Pessimistic: 16 hours (issues)
Estimate = (4 + 32 + 16) / 6 = 8.7 hours

Buffers:
- Individual tasks: 20%
- Phase total: 30%
- Project total: 40%
```

## Best Practices

| Do | Avoid |
|----|-------|
| Keep tasks to 2-4 hour chunks | Vague tasks ("implement feature") |
| Include exact file locations | Skipping background/context |
| Specify clear acceptance criteria | Ignoring non-functional requirements |
| Map dependencies explicitly | Underestimating integration work |
| Build in buffer for unknowns | Planning more than 2 weeks in detail |
| Include testing in the plan | Hiding risks or uncertainties |
| Review plan with stakeholders | Assuming requirements are complete |
| Update plan as you learn | Forgetting rollback plans |
