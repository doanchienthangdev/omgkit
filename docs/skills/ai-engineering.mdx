## Development Process

```
1. Use Case Evaluation → 2. Model Selection → 3. Evaluation Pipeline
                                                      ↓
4. Prompt Engineering → 5. Context (RAG/Agents) → 6. Finetuning (if needed)
                                                      ↓
7. Inference Optimization → 8. Deployment → 9. Monitoring & Feedback
```

## Quick Decision Guide
