## Overview

Plan with parallel execution strategy

## Quick Start

```bash
/plan-parallel
```

# 📋 Parallel Plan: $ARGUMENTS

Plan optimized for parallel agent execution.

## Strategy
1. Identify independent tasks
2. Group by agent type
3. Define sync points
4. Plan parallel streams

## Output Format
```markdown
# Parallel Plan: [Feature]

## Stream A (fullstack-developer)
1. [Task A1]
2. [Task A2]

## Stream B (tester)
1. [Task B1]
2. [Task B2]

## Sync Points
- After A2 + B1: Integration
- After all: Final review

## Execution Order
[A1, B1] → [A2, B2] → [Sync] → [Final]
```

## Tools Used

This command leverages the following capabilities:

<Check>**Task** - Orchestrates complex multi-step operations</Check>
<Check>**Read** - Analyzes files and codebase context</Check>
<Check>**Write** - Creates and modifies files</Check>
<Check>**Bash** - Executes system commands</Check>
<Check>**Grep** - Searches code patterns</Check>
<Check>**Glob** - Finds files by pattern</Check>

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```bash
/plan-parallel
```

### With Context

```bash
# First, ensure context is loaded
/index

# Then run the command
/plan-parallel
```

### Combined with Other Commands

```bash
# Example workflow
/plan "describe your goal"
/plan-parallel
/commit
```

## Best Practices

<Check>Be specific in your descriptions</Check>
<Check>Include relevant file paths when applicable</Check>
<Check>Use in combination with other commands for complex workflows</Check>
<Check>Run `/index` first for full codebase context</Check>

## Tips

<Note>
For best results, provide detailed descriptions and include relevant context about your project structure.
