## Overview

Start autonomous execution from current state

## Quick Start

```bash
/auto:start "[--from-phase
```


# Autonomous Execution Start

Begin autonomous project development from current state.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, verify:
1. `.omgkit/state.yaml` exists (created by `/auto:init`)
2. `.omgkit/generated/prd.md` exists (discovery completed)
3. No pending checkpoints require approval

## Execution Flow

### 1. Load State

```yaml
# Read from .omgkit/state.yaml
project:
  name: "Project Name"
  type: "saas"
  archetype: "saas-mvp"
phase: "planning"  # Current phase
status: "ready"    # ready | in_progress | checkpoint | blocked | completed
```

### 2. Load Archetype

Based on `project.archetype`, load the corresponding archetype definition:
- `plugin/templates/autonomous/archetypes/{archetype}.yaml`

### 3. Determine Next Actions

From the archetype phases, find the current phase and its:
- **workflows**: Execute these workflows in order
- **features**: Execute per-feature workflows
- **steps**: Execute manual steps
- **checkpoint**: If true, pause for user approval

### 4. Execute Phase

For each item in the current phase:

#### If workflow:
```
Run workflow: {workflow-name}
```

#### If feature (dynamic phase):
```
For each feature in .omgkit/generated/features.yaml:
  1. Run per_feature workflows (feature, test, code-review)
  2. Run quality_gates.after_feature checks
  3. Update feature status in state
```

#### If step:
```
Execute step actions
Update step completion in state
```

### 5. Quality Gates

After completing phase actions, run quality gates:

```yaml
quality_gates:
  after_feature:
    - command: "npm test"
      required: true
  before_checkpoint:
    - command: "npm run build"
      required: true
```

If any required gate fails:
1. Log the failure
2. Set status to "blocked"
3. Report to user with fix suggestions

### 6. Update State

After each significant action:
```yaml
# Update .omgkit/state.yaml
progress:
  current_feature: "feature_id"
  current_step: 3
  steps_completed: ["step1", "step2"]
```

### 7. Handle Checkpoints

When reaching a checkpoint:
1. Set `status: "checkpoint"`
2. Set `checkpoint.pending: true`
3. Generate checkpoint summary
4. Pause and notify user

```
## Checkpoint: {phase_name}

### Completed
- [x] Step 1
- [x] Step 2

### Generated Artifacts
- path/to/artifact1
- path/to/artifact2

### Quality Gate Results
- npm test: PASSED
- npm run build: PASSED

**ACTION REQUIRED**: Run `/auto:approve` to continue or `/auto:reject` with feedback.
```

## Autonomy Levels

Respect autonomy levels from archetype:

```yaml
autonomy:
  default_level: 1
  rules:
    - patterns: ["**/migrations/**"]
      level: 3  # Requires explicit approval
    - patterns: ["**/auth/**"]
      level: 3
```

**Level 0**: Auto-execute, no confirmation
**Level 1**: Execute with notification
**Level 2**: Preview before executing, quick approval
**Level 3**: Full review required
**Level 4**: Human must do it

For levels 2-4:
1. Show what will be done
2. Wait for `/auto:approve` or `/auto:reject`

## Memory Updates

After significant work:
1. Update `.omgkit/memory/journal/{date}.md`
2. Record decisions in `.omgkit/memory/decisions/`
3. Update context files as needed

## Error Handling

On error:
1. Log error details to `.omgkit/logs/`
2. Set `status: "blocked"`
3. Store error context for resume
4. Notify user with:
   - What failed
   - Why it might have failed
   - Suggested fixes
   - How to resume after fixing

## Resume Support

State is saved after every action for reliable resume:
```yaml
resume_point:
  phase: "backend"
  feature: "user_authentication"
  step: "implement_login"
  attempt: 2
```

## Output

Display progress as work proceeds:

```
## Autonomous Execution Started

**Project:** [Name]
**Phase:** [Current Phase]
**Mode:** [Archetype]

### Progress

[■■■■■□□□□□] 50% - Implementing user_authentication

#### Current Task
Implementing login endpoint...

#### Recent Actions
- ✓ Created User model
- ✓ Added password hashing
- → Implementing login route

#### Next Up
- Password reset
- Session management
```

## Commands During Execution

User can run these during execution:
- `/auto:status` - Show detailed status
- `/auto:pause` - Pause after current task
- `/auto:checkpoint` - Force a checkpoint
- `/auto:reject [reason]` - Stop and provide feedback
