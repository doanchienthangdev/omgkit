  **Category:** Auto

  **Syntax:** `/auto:reject "<reason> [--checkpoint | --decision <id>]"`
</Info>

## Overview

Reject checkpoint or decision with feedback

## Quick Start

```bash
/auto:reject ""reason"
```


# Reject Checkpoint or Decision

Reject a pending checkpoint or decision and provide feedback for revision.

## Usage

### Reject with Reason
```bash
/auto:reject "The schema needs a soft delete column for users"
```

### Reject Specific Checkpoint
```bash
/auto:reject --checkpoint "API endpoints don't match PRD requirements"
```

### Reject Specific Decision
```bash
/auto:reject --decision db_index_strategy "Use separate indexes instead"
```

## Rejection Process

### 1. Capture Feedback

Parse the rejection reason and categorize:
- **Scope change**: Requirements changed
- **Quality issue**: Doesn't meet standards
- **Design issue**: Approach needs revision
- **Missing item**: Something was forgotten
- **Other**: Custom feedback

### 2. Update State

```yaml
# .omgkit/state.yaml
checkpoint:
  pending: true
  rejected: true
  rejection:
    reason: "The schema needs a soft delete column for users"
    category: "missing_item"
    timestamp: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"

status: "revision_needed"
```

### 3. Analyze Impact

Determine what needs to change:
```yaml
impact_analysis:
  files_to_revise:
    - ".omgkit/generated/schema.sql"
    - "prisma/schema.prisma"
  decisions_affected:
    - "user_model_design"
  estimated_rework: "minor"  # minor | moderate | major
```

### 4. Generate Revision Plan

Based on feedback, create revision tasks:
```yaml
revision_tasks:
  - id: "add_soft_delete"
    description: "Add deleted_at column to users table"
    files:
      - "schema.sql"
      - "schema.prisma"
  - id: "update_queries"
    description: "Add soft delete filter to user queries"
    files:
      - "user.service.ts"
```

### 5. Record in Memory

Save rejection for learning:
```markdown
# Rejection: Planning Phase

**Date:** 2024-01-15
**Phase:** Planning
**Reason:** The schema needs a soft delete column for users

## Original Approach
Schema designed without soft delete capability.

## Feedback
User requires soft delete for data recovery and audit purposes.

## Revision Plan
1. Add deleted_at column to users table
2. Update queries to filter deleted records
3. Add restore functionality

## Lessons
- Always consider data retention requirements early
- Include soft delete in standard entity patterns
```

## Output

### Checkpoint Rejection
```
## Checkpoint Rejected

**Phase:** Planning
**Reason:** The schema needs a soft delete column for users

### Impact Analysis

**Severity:** Minor
**Files Affected:** 2

1. `.omgkit/generated/schema.sql`
   - Add: `deleted_at TIMESTAMP NULL`

2. `prisma/schema.prisma` (when created)
   - Add: `deletedAt DateTime?`

### Revision Plan

I'll make the following changes:

1. **Update Schema**
   - Add `deleted_at` column to users table
   - Add index on `deleted_at` for query performance

2. **Update Queries** (during implementation)
   - Filter `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` by default
   - Add methods for soft delete and restore

### Proceeding with Revision

Would you like me to:
A. Revise the schema now and show you the updated version
B. Note this for implementation phase
C. Discuss the soft delete approach further

---

**Commands:**
- `/auto:resume` - After approving revision
- `/auto:status` - Check current state
```

### Decision Rejection
```
## Decision Rejected

**Decision:** db_index_strategy
**Original:** Add composite index on users(email, status)
**Rejection:** Use separate indexes instead

### Alternative Approach

Based on your feedback, will use:
```sql
-- Instead of composite index
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_status ON users(status);
```

### Trade-offs

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| Composite | Faster combined queries | Less flexible |
| Separate | More query patterns | More storage |

### Updated Decision

Recorded your preference for separate indexes.

---

**Commands:**
- `/auto:approve decision db_index_strategy` - If revised version is acceptable
- `/auto:start` - Continue with new approach
```

## Rejection with Questions

If feedback is unclear, ask clarifying questions:

```
## Clarification Needed

**Your Feedback:** "The schema needs work"

I'd like to understand better:

1. **Which tables need changes?**
   A. Users table
   B. All tables
   C. Specific tables: [specify]

2. **What type of changes?**
   A. Add columns
   B. Change relationships
   C. Performance optimization
   D. Other: [specify]

3. **Any specific requirements?**
   [Open response]

Please provide more details so I can make the right revisions.
```

## Major Rejection

For significant rejections that require major rework:

```
## Major Revision Required

**Feedback:** "We need to switch from SQL to MongoDB"

### Impact Assessment

**Severity:** Major
**Rework Required:** Significant

### Affected Artifacts
- ❌ `.omgkit/generated/schema.sql` - Will be replaced
- ⚠️ `.omgkit/generated/prd.md` - Needs update
- ⚠️ `.omgkit/generated/technical-spec.md` - Needs update

### Recommended Action

This is a fundamental architecture change. I recommend:

1. **Return to Discovery** - Update technical requirements
2. **Update PRD** - Reflect database change
3. **New Technical Spec** - Design for MongoDB
4. **Restart Planning** - New schema design

### Alternative

If you want to minimize rework:
- Keep current phase artifacts
- Add MongoDB migration as future task
- Continue with SQL for MVP

---

**Which approach would you prefer?**

A. Full revision (return to discovery)
B. Partial revision (update planning only)
C. Note for future (continue current path)
D. Discuss further
```
