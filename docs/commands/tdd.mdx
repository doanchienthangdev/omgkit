<Info>
  **Category:** Dev

  **Syntax:** `/dev:tdd <feature> [--coverage PERCENT] [--test-types TYPES]`
</Info>

## Overview

Test-driven development workflow with enforced test-first methodology

## Quick Start

```bash
/dev:tdd "feature"
```


# 🔴🟢♻️ TDD: \<feature\> [--coverage PERCENT] [--test-types TYPES]

Test-driven development for: **\<feature\> [--coverage PERCENT] [--test-types TYPES]**

## TDD Cycle
1. 🔴 **RED** - Write failing test
2. 🟢 **GREEN** - Make it pass (minimal code)
3. ♻️ **REFACTOR** - Improve code
4. Repeat

## Rules
- No production code without failing test
- Only enough code to pass test
- Refactor only when green

## Testing Options

This command **always enforces testing** (TDD by definition). Testing cannot be disabled.

### Options

| Option | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--coverage <percent>` | Set minimum coverage | `/dev:tdd "auth" --coverage 95` |
| `--test-types <types>` | Specify test types | `/dev:tdd "api" --test-types unit,integration` |

### Coverage Requirements

TDD defaults to high coverage requirements:
- **Minimum**: 90% (higher than standard commands)
- **Target**: 95%

## Process
For each requirement:
1. Write test first
2. Run test (should fail)
3. Write minimal code to pass
4. Run test (should pass)
5. Refactor if needed
6. Next requirement

## Configuration

Configure via `.omgkit/workflow.yaml`:

```yaml
testing:
  enabled: true
  coverage_gates:
    unit:
      minimum: 90
      target: 95
```

## Examples

```bash
# Standard TDD workflow
/dev:tdd "user authentication"

# TDD with specific coverage target
/dev:tdd "payment processing" --coverage 95

# TDD with specific test types
/dev:tdd "API endpoint" --test-types unit,integration,contract
```



## Tools Used
