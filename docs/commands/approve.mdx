</Info>

## Overview

Approve checkpoint or pending decision to continue

## Quick Start

```bash
/auto:approve "[checkpoint
```


# Approve Checkpoint or Decision

Approve a pending checkpoint or autonomy decision to continue execution.

## Usage

### Approve Current Checkpoint
```bash
/auto:approve
/auto:approve checkpoint
```

### Approve Specific Decision
```bash
/auto:approve decision db_index_strategy
```

### Approve All Pending
```bash
/auto:approve --all
```

## Approval Process

### 1. Check Pending Items

Load from `.omgkit/state.yaml`:
```yaml
checkpoint:
  pending: true
  type: "phase"
  phase: "planning"
  description: "Planning phase complete. Review artifacts."
  artifacts:
    - ".omgkit/generated/schema.sql"
    - ".omgkit/generated/api-spec.md"

pending_decisions:
  - id: "db_index_strategy"
    level: 2
    description: "Add composite index on users(email, status)"
    options:
      - "approve"
      - "modify"
      - "reject"
  - id: "auth_token_expiry"
    level: 2
    description: "Set JWT expiry to 24 hours"
```

### 2. Validate Approval

For checkpoint:
- Check artifacts exist
- Verify quality gates passed
- Confirm user has reviewed

For decision:
- Check decision exists
- Validate decision is pending
- Record approval with timestamp

### 3. Update State

```yaml
# After checkpoint approval
checkpoint:
  pending: false
  approved_at: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  approved_by: "user"

status: "ready"  # Changed from "checkpoint"

# After decision approval
decisions_log:
  - id: "db_index_strategy"
    decision: "approved"
    timestamp: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"

pending_decisions: []  # Removed approved item
```

### 4. Record in Memory

Create decision record at `.omgkit/memory/decisions/`:
```markdown
# Decision: Database Index Strategy

**Date:** 2024-01-15
**Phase:** Planning
**Status:** Approved

## Context
During schema design, identified need for efficient user lookup by email and status.

## Decision
Add composite index on users(email, status) table.

## Rationale
- Improves login query performance
- Supports filtering by account status
- Minimal storage overhead

## Consequences
- Slightly slower inserts
- Index maintenance on updates
```

### 5. Continue Execution

After approval:
1. Log the approval
2. Update state to "ready"
3. Prompt to continue

## Output

### Checkpoint Approval

- `/auto:approve --all` - Approve all remaining
- `/auto:start` - Continue (pending decisions will prompt)
```

### Approve All
```
## All Items Approved ✓

### Checkpoint
- ✓ Planning phase

### Decisions (2)
- ✓ db_index_strategy: Add composite index
- ✓ auth_token_expiry: 24 hour JWT expiry

### Summary
- Checkpoints approved: 1
- Decisions approved: 2
- All items recorded in memory

### Ready to Continue

---

**Commands:**
- `/auto:start` - Continue execution
```

## Nothing to Approve

```
## No Pending Approvals

Current status: **In Progress**

There are no checkpoints or decisions waiting for approval.

### Current State
- Phase: Backend
- Feature: user_authentication
- Progress: 3/7 steps complete

---

**Commands:**
- `/auto:status` - View full status
- `/auto:next` - Preview next action
```

## Conditional Approval

For complex decisions, you can approve with conditions:

```bash
/auto:approve decision db_index_strategy --with-note "Also add index on created_at"
```

Output:
```
## Decision Approved with Note ✓

**Decision:** db_index_strategy
**Note Added:** "Also add index on created_at"

This note will be considered during implementation.
```
