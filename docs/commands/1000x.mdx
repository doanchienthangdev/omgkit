## Overview

Find 1000x moonshot path

## Quick Start

```bash

```

# 🌙 1000x: $ARGUMENTS

1000x moonshot for: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Moonshot Questions
1. What would Google/Apple/OpenAI do?
2. What makes this problem obsolete?
3. What tech enables 1000x in 5 years?
4. What if we had unlimited resources?
5. What would a 10-year-old suggest?

## Revolutionary Thinking
- Challenge every assumption
- Ignore current constraints
- Think from first principles
- Consider exponential tech
