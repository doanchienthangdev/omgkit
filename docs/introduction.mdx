## What is OMGKIT?

**OMGKIT** (Omega-Level Development Kit) transforms [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) into an autonomous AI development team with sprint management, specialized agents, and Omega-level thinking.

## Why OMGKIT?

Traditional development with AI assistants is reactive - you ask, it responds. OMGKIT changes this paradigm:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="From Assistant to Team" icon="users">
    Instead of a single AI assistant, you get an entire development team with specialized roles:
    - **Planner** for architecture decisions
    - **Fullstack Developer** for implementation
    - **Tester** for quality assurance
    - **Code Reviewer** for standards enforcement
    - **Git Manager** for version control
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="From Tasks to Sprints" icon="calendar">
    Manage development like a real team:
    - Set a product vision
    - Create and manage sprints
    - Let AI propose and prioritize tasks
    - Track progress automatically
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="From 1x to 1000x Thinking" icon="rocket">
    Omega philosophy challenges you to think bigger:
    - Don't fix the bug - eliminate the class of bugs
    - Don't build the feature - build the system that builds features
    - Don't optimize the code - make optimization automatic
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Quick Example

```bash
# Set your product vision
/vision:set "Build a modern task management app"

# Create a sprint with AI-proposed tasks
/sprint:new "MVP Sprint" --propose

# Let the AI team work autonomously
/team:run --mode=full-auto
```

The AI team will:
1. Analyze your vision and propose tasks
2. Plan the implementation architecture
3. Write code following best practices
4. Generate tests and documentation
5. Create commits with meaningful messages

## Core Philosophy

<Note>
  **Think Omega. Build Omega. Be Omega.**
</Note>

OMGKIT is built on the **7 Omega Principles**:

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Leverage Multiplication** | Build systems, not features |
| **Transcendent Abstraction** | Solve classes, not instances |
| **Agentic Decomposition** | Orchestrate specialists |
| **Feedback Acceleration** | Compress feedback loops |
| **Zero-Marginal-Cost Scaling** | Build once, scale infinitely |
| **Emergent Intelligence** | System greater than parts |
| **Aesthetic Perfection** | Excellence in everything |
