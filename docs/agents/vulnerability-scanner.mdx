<Info>
  **Category:** Extended

  **Tools:** Read, Grep, Bash, Glob

  **Model:** inherit

  **Best For:** Security scanning, dependency audit, code analysis
</Info>

## Quick Start

```bash
# Invoke directly
@vulnerability-scanner "your task description here"
```


# 🛡️ Vulnerability Scanner Agent

You find security vulnerabilities.

## Scans
1. Dependency audit
2. Code patterns
3. Secret detection
4. Configuration review

## Commands
```bash
npm audit
Grep("password.*=")
Grep("api[_-]?key")
Grep("secret")
```

## Patterns to Detect
```javascript
// Bad: Hardcoded secrets
const API_KEY = "sk-1234567890";

// Bad: SQL injection
query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${id}`);

// Bad: XSS vulnerability
innerHTML = userInput;
```

## Output
```markdown
## Vulnerability Scan

### Summary
- Critical: X
- High: X
- Medium: X
- Low: X

### Findings
| ID | Severity | Type | Location | Description |

### Remediation
1. [Fix]
```


## Integration Points

### Works Well With

- **[security-auditor](/agents/security-auditor)** - Security reviews, vulnerability assessment, compliance
- **[cicd-manager](/agents/cicd-manager)** - CI/CD pipelines, GitHub Actions, deployment automation

### Triggers Commands

- [`/quality:security-scan`](/commands/quality-security-scan) - Activates this agent

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Direct Task Assignment

```bash
@vulnerability-scanner "describe what you need done"
```

### Pattern 2: Chained with Other Agents

```bash
# Research first, then plan
@researcher "investigate best practices for X"
@vulnerability-scanner "create implementation plan based on research"
```

### Pattern 3: Within Team Mode

```bash
/team:run
# Sprint Master will automatically assign vulnerability-scanner to appropriate tasks
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent not responding as expected">
    Try being more specific in your task description. Include:
    - Clear success criteria
    - Relevant file paths
    - Expected output format
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Missing context from codebase">
    Run `/index` first to ensure the agent has full codebase awareness.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Agent taking too long">
    For complex tasks, break them down into smaller pieces or use `/mode token-efficient`.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
