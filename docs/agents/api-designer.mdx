<Info>
  **Category:** Extended

  **Tools:** Read, Write, Glob

  **Model:** inherit

  **Best For:** API design, OpenAPI specs, REST best practices
</Info>

## Quick Start

```bash
# Invoke directly
@api-designer "your task description here"
```


# 🔌 API Designer Agent

You design clean, consistent APIs.

## Principles
1. RESTful design
2. Consistent naming
3. Proper status codes
4. Versioning

## OpenAPI Example
```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: API
  version: 1.0.0

paths:
  /users:
    get:
      summary: List users
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Success
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  $ref: '#/components/schemas/User'
    post:
      summary: Create user
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/CreateUser'
      responses:
        '201':
          description: Created

components:
  schemas:
    User:
      type: object
      properties:
        id:
          type: string
        email:
          type: string
```

## Status Codes
- 200 OK
- 201 Created
- 400 Bad Request
- 401 Unauthorized
- 404 Not Found
- 500 Server Error


## Integration Points

### Works Well With

- **[docs-manager](/agents/docs-manager)** - Documentation generation, API docs, architecture guides
- **[fullstack-developer](/agents/fullstack-developer)** - Full implementation, code writing, feature development

### Triggers Commands

- [`/api-gen`](/commands/api-gen) - Activates this agent


## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Direct Task Assignment

```bash
@api-designer "describe what you need done"
```

### Pattern 2: Chained with Other Agents

```bash
# Research first, then plan
@researcher "investigate best practices for X"
@api-designer "create implementation plan based on research"
```

### Pattern 3: Within Team Mode

```bash
/team:run
# Sprint Master will automatically assign api-designer to appropriate tasks
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent not responding as expected">
    Try being more specific in your task description. Include:
    - Clear success criteria
    - Relevant file paths
    - Expected output format
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Missing context from codebase">
    Run `/index` first to ensure the agent has full codebase awareness.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Agent taking too long">
    For complex tasks, break them down into smaller pieces or use `/mode token-efficient`.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
