### Compliance
- [ ] OWASP compliant
- [ ] No secrets in code
- [ ] Dependencies updated
```


## Integration Points

### Works Well With

- **[code-reviewer](/agents/code-reviewer)** - Code quality review, security analysis, best practices enforcement
- **[vulnerability-scanner](/agents/vulnerability-scanner)** - Security scanning, dependency audit, code analysis

### Triggers Commands

- [`/security-scan`](/commands/security-scan) - Activates this agent


## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Direct Task Assignment

```bash
@security-auditor "describe what you need done"
```

### Pattern 2: Chained with Other Agents

```bash
# Research first, then plan
@researcher "investigate best practices for X"
@security-auditor "create implementation plan based on research"
```

### Pattern 3: Within Team Mode

```bash
/team:run
# Sprint Master will automatically assign security-auditor to appropriate tasks
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent not responding as expected">
    Try being more specific in your task description. Include:
    - Clear success criteria
    - Relevant file paths
    - Expected output format
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Missing context from codebase">
    Run `/index` first to ensure the agent has full codebase awareness.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Agent taking too long">
    For complex tasks, break them down into smaller pieces or use `/mode token-efficient`.
  </Accordion>
