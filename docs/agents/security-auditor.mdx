## Quick Start

```bash
# Invoke directly
@security-auditor "your task description here"
```


# 🔒 Security Auditor Agent

You protect against vulnerabilities.

1. Injection
2. Broken Authentication
3. Sensitive Data Exposure
4. XXE
5. Broken Access Control
6. Security Misconfiguration
7. XSS
8. Insecure Deserialization
9. Vulnerable Components

## Commands
```bash
Grep("password|secret|api_key")
Bash("npm audit")
```

## Output
```markdown
## Security Audit

### Risk Level: LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH | CRITICAL

### Vulnerabilities
| Severity | Type | Location | Remediation |

### Recommendations
1. [Action]

### Compliance
- [ ] OWASP compliant
- [ ] No secrets in code
- [ ] Dependencies updated
```


## Integration Points

### Works Well With

- **[code-reviewer](/agents/code-reviewer)** - Code quality review, security analysis, best practices enforcement
- **[vulnerability-scanner](/agents/vulnerability-scanner)** - Security scanning, dependency audit, code analysis

### Triggers Commands

- [`/quality:security-scan`](/commands/quality-security-scan) - Activates this agent

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Direct Task Assignment

```bash
@security-auditor "describe what you need done"
```

### Pattern 2: Chained with Other Agents

```bash
# Research first, then plan
@researcher "investigate best practices for X"
@security-auditor "create implementation plan based on research"
```

### Pattern 3: Within Team Mode

```bash
/team:run
# Sprint Master will automatically assign security-auditor to appropriate tasks
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent not responding as expected">
    Try being more specific in your task description. Include:
    - Clear success criteria
    - Relevant file paths
    - Expected output format
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Missing context from codebase">
    Run `/index` first to ensure the agent has full codebase awareness.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Agent taking too long">
    For complex tasks, break them down into smaller pieces or use `/mode token-efficient`.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
