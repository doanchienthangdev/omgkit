## Pipeline Patterns

### ETL Pipeline
```
Extract → Transform → Load
- Extract from sources (APIs, DBs, files)
- Transform (clean, enrich, aggregate)
- Load to destination (warehouse, lake)
```

### ELT Pipeline
```
Extract → Load → Transform
- Extract raw data
- Load to staging
- Transform in-place (dbt)
```

### Streaming Pipeline
```
Source → Process → Sink
- Kafka/Kinesis source
- Flink/Spark Streaming process
- Multiple sinks (DB, lake, cache)
```

### Feature Pipeline
```
Raw Data → Features → Feature Store
- Compute features
- Store online/offline
- Serve for inference
```

## Data Quality Framework

### Expectations
```python
# Great Expectations example patterns
expect_column_values_to_not_be_null(column)
expect_column_values_to_be_between(column, min, max)
expect_column_values_to_be_unique(column)
expect_column_values_to_match_regex(column, regex)
expect_table_row_count_to_be_between(min, max)
```

### Data Contracts
```yaml
# Schema contract
schema:
  fields:
    - name: user_id
      type: string
      nullable: false
      unique: true
    - name: created_at
      type: timestamp
      nullable: false
  freshness:
    max_age_hours: 24
  volume:
    min_rows: 1000
    max_rows: 1000000
```

```

## Best Practices

### Pipeline Design
1. **Idempotency**: Re-running produces same results
2. **Atomicity**: All-or-nothing operations
3. **Incremental**: Process only new/changed data
4. **Backfill-able**: Can reprocess historical data
5. **Observable**: Metrics, logs, lineage

### Data Modeling
1. **Slowly Changing Dimensions**: Handle changes properly
2. **Fact Tables**: Denormalized for analytics
3. **Data Vault**: For flexibility and auditability
4. **Wide Tables**: For ML feature engineering

### Error Handling
1. **Dead Letter Queues**: Capture failed records
2. **Retry Logic**: With exponential backoff
3. **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascade failures
4. **Alerting**: Proactive notification

## Collaboration

Works closely with:
- **ml-engineer**: For feature pipelines
- **architect**: For infrastructure decisions
- **database-admin**: For storage optimization

## Example Pipeline

### Daily User Activity Pipeline

```python
# Dagster example structure
@asset
def raw_events():
    """Extract events from Kafka"""
    pass

@asset
def cleaned_events(raw_events):
    """Clean and validate events"""
    pass

@asset
def user_activity_daily(cleaned_events):
    """Aggregate to daily user metrics"""
    pass

@asset
def feature_store_sync(user_activity_daily):
    """Sync to feature store"""
    pass
```

**Quality Checks:**
- No null user_ids
- Event timestamps within expected range
- Row count within 20% of previous day
- All required fields present

**Monitoring:**
- Pipeline duration
- Records processed
- Quality check pass rate
- Data freshness


## Integration Points

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Direct Task Assignment

```bash
@data-engineer "describe what you need done"
```

### Pattern 2: Chained with Other Agents

```bash
# Research first, then plan
@researcher "investigate best practices for X"
@data-engineer "create implementation plan based on research"
```

### Pattern 3: Within Team Mode

```bash
/team:run
# Sprint Master will automatically assign data-engineer to appropriate tasks
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent not responding as expected">
    Try being more specific in your task description. Include:
    - Clear success criteria
    - Relevant file paths
    - Expected output format
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Missing context from codebase">
    Run `/index` first to ensure the agent has full codebase awareness.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Agent taking too long">
    For complex tasks, break them down into smaller pieces or use `/mode token-efficient`.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
