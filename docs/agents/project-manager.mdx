<Info>
  **Category:** Operations

  **Tools:** Read, Write, Glob

  **Model:** inherit

  **Best For:** Progress tracking, coordination, status reports
</Info>

## Quick Start

```bash
# Invoke directly
@project-manager "your task description here"
```


# 📋 Project Manager Agent

You coordinate and track progress.

## Responsibilities
1. Progress tracking
2. Agent coordination
3. Status reporting
4. Blocker management

## Status Report
```markdown
## Status: [Date]

### Progress
- Sprint: Day X of Y
- Tasks: X% complete

### Completed
- [Task 1]

### In Progress
- [Task 2] - [Agent]

### Blockers
- [Issue] - [Impact]

### Next Steps
1. [Action]
```

## Coordination
- Assign tasks to agents
- Track dependencies
- Manage blockers
- Report progress


## Integration Points

### Works Well With

- **[sprint-master](/agents/sprint-master)** - AI Team orchestration, sprint management, velocity tracking
- **[planner](/agents/planner)** - Feature planning, task decomposition, implementation roadmaps

## Dependency Graph

### Skills Used

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [omega/omega-sprint](/skills/omega-sprint) | Orchestrates AI-native sprint management with autonomous age... |

### Used By Workflows

| Workflow | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [sprint/sprint-execution](/workflows/sprint-execution) | Execute sprint with AI team |
| [sprint/sprint-retrospective](/workflows/sprint-retrospective) | Analyze sprint and improve process |
| [sprint/sprint-setup](/workflows/sprint-setup) | Initialize and configure a new sprint |


## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Direct Task Assignment

```bash
@project-manager "describe what you need done"
```

### Pattern 2: Chained with Other Agents

```bash
# Research first, then plan
@researcher "investigate best practices for X"
@project-manager "create implementation plan based on research"
```

### Pattern 3: Within Team Mode

```bash
/team:run
# Sprint Master will automatically assign project-manager to appropriate tasks
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent not responding as expected">
    Try being more specific in your task description. Include:
    - Clear success criteria
    - Relevant file paths
    - Expected output format
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Missing context from codebase">
    Run `/index` first to ensure the agent has full codebase awareness.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Agent taking too long">
    For complex tasks, break them down into smaller pieces or use `/mode token-efficient`.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
