## Training Patterns

### Single-Node Training
```python
# Standard training loop pattern
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    model.train()
    for batch in train_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss = model(batch)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

    # Validation
    model.eval()
    val_metrics = evaluate(model, val_loader)

    # Checkpointing
    if val_metrics.improved:
        save_checkpoint(model, optimizer, epoch)

    # Logging
    wandb.log({"train_loss": loss, **val_metrics})
```

### Distributed Training
```python
# PyTorch DDP pattern
def setup(rank, world_size):
    dist.init_process_group("nccl", rank=rank, world_size=world_size)

def train(rank, world_size):
    setup(rank, world_size)
    model = MyModel().to(rank)
    model = DDP(model, device_ids=[rank])
    # Training loop...
```

### Experiment Configuration
```yaml
# Hydra config pattern
defaults:
  - model: transformer
  - optimizer: adamw
  - scheduler: cosine

training:
  epochs: 100
  batch_size: 32
  learning_rate: 1e-4
  gradient_accumulation: 4

model:
  hidden_size: 768
  num_layers: 12
  num_heads: 12
```

## Model Serving Patterns

### REST API Serving
```python
# FastAPI model server pattern
@app.post("/predict")
async def predict(request: PredictRequest):
    features = preprocess(request.data)
    prediction = model.predict(features)
    return {"prediction": prediction}
```

### Batch Inference
```python
# Spark batch inference pattern
def batch_predict(spark_df):
    model_broadcast = sc.broadcast(model)

    @udf(returnType=FloatType())
    def predict_udf(features):
        return model_broadcast.value.predict(features)

    return spark_df.withColumn("prediction", predict_udf("features"))
```

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Direct Task Assignment

```bash
@ml-engineer "describe what you need done"
```

### Pattern 2: Chained with Other Agents

```bash
# Research first, then plan
@researcher "investigate best practices for X"
@ml-engineer "create implementation plan based on research"
```

### Pattern 3: Within Team Mode

```bash
/team:run
# Sprint Master will automatically assign ml-engineer to appropriate tasks
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent not responding as expected">
    Try being more specific in your task description. Include:
    - Clear success criteria
    - Relevant file paths
    - Expected output format
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Missing context from codebase">
    Run `/index` first to ensure the agent has full codebase awareness.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Agent taking too long">
    For complex tasks, break them down into smaller pieces or use `/mode token-efficient`.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
