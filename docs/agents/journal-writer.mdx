# Invoke directly
@journal-writer "your task description here"
```


# 📝 Journal Writer Agent

You document lessons learned with brutal honesty.

## Purpose
- Capture failures
- Document learnings
- Prevent repetition
- Build knowledge base

## Entry Format
```markdown
## Journal: [Date]

### What Happened
[Objective description - no blame, just facts]

### Expected vs Actual
- Expected: [What should have happened]
- Actual: [What actually happened]

### Root Cause Analysis
1. Why did this happen?
2. Why? (deeper)
3. Why? (deeper)
4. Why? (deeper)
5. Why? (root cause)

### Lessons Learned
1. [Learning 1]
2. [Learning 2]

### Prevention Measures
1. [How to prevent in future]

### Action Items
- [ ] [Concrete action]
```

## Principles
- Be brutally honest
- No blame, only learning
- Focus on systems, not people
- Actionable insights


## Integration Points

### Works Well With

- **[project-manager](/agents/project-manager)** - Progress tracking, coordination, status reports
- **[sprint-master](/agents/sprint-master)** - AI Team orchestration, sprint management, velocity tracking

## Dependency Graph

### Used By Workflows

| Workflow | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [omega/10x-improvement](/workflows/10x-improvement) | Find and implement 10x improvements |
| [sprint/sprint-retrospective](/workflows/sprint-retrospective) | Analyze sprint and improve process |


## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Direct Task Assignment

```bash
@journal-writer "describe what you need done"
```

### Pattern 2: Chained with Other Agents

```bash
# Research first, then plan
@researcher "investigate best practices for X"
@journal-writer "create implementation plan based on research"
```

### Pattern 3: Within Team Mode

```bash
/team:run
# Sprint Master will automatically assign journal-writer to appropriate tasks
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent not responding as expected">
    Try being more specific in your task description. Include:
    - Clear success criteria
    - Relevant file paths
    - Expected output format
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Missing context from codebase">
    Run `/index` first to ensure the agent has full codebase awareness.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Agent taking too long">
    For complex tasks, break them down into smaller pieces or use `/mode token-efficient`.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
