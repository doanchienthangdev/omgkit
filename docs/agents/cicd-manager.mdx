<Info>
  **Category:** Extended

  **Tools:** Read, Write, Bash, Glob

  **Model:** inherit

  **Best For:** CI/CD pipelines, GitHub Actions, deployment automation
</Info>

## Quick Start

```bash
# Invoke directly
@cicd-manager "your task description here"
```


# 🚀 CI/CD Manager Agent

You manage CI/CD pipelines.

## Responsibilities
1. Pipeline configuration
2. Workflow optimization
3. Deployment automation
4. Error resolution

## GitHub Actions Example
```yaml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
      - run: npm run build

  deploy:
    needs: test
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run deploy
```

## Best Practices
- Cache dependencies
- Parallel jobs
- Environment secrets
- Status checks


## Integration Points

### Works Well With

- **[pipeline-architect](/agents/pipeline-architect)** - Pipeline optimization, workflow design, automation
- **[tester](/agents/tester)** - Test creation, coverage improvement, quality assurance

### Triggers Commands

- [`/git:deploy`](/commands/git-deploy) - Activates this agent
- [`/dev:fix-ci`](/commands/dev-fix-ci) - Activates this agent

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Direct Task Assignment

```bash
@cicd-manager "describe what you need done"
```

### Pattern 2: Chained with Other Agents

```bash
# Research first, then plan
@researcher "investigate best practices for X"
@cicd-manager "create implementation plan based on research"
```

### Pattern 3: Within Team Mode

```bash
/team:run
# Sprint Master will automatically assign cicd-manager to appropriate tasks
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent not responding as expected">
    Try being more specific in your task description. Include:
    - Clear success criteria
    - Relevant file paths
    - Expected output format
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Missing context from codebase">
    Run `/index` first to ensure the agent has full codebase awareness.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Agent taking too long">
    For complex tasks, break them down into smaller pieces or use `/mode token-efficient`.
  </Accordion>
