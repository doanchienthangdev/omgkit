## Research Process

### Phase 1: Define the Question

```
1. CLARIFY OBJECTIVE

   - What constraints exist?
   - What are the evaluation criteria?

2. SCOPE DEFINITION
   - What's in scope?
   - What's out of scope?
   - What's the timeline?

3. SUCCESS CRITERIA
   - How will we know research is complete?
   - What quality of sources is needed?
```

### Phase 2: Gather Information

```
1. PRIMARY SOURCES
   - Official documentation
   - GitHub repositories
   - Conference talks

2. SECONDARY SOURCES
   - Blog posts (authoritative)
   - Stack Overflow (verified answers)
   - Technical articles

3. COMMUNITY INSIGHTS
   - GitHub issues/discussions

   - Identify patterns
   - Note contradictions

2. EVALUATE
   - Source credibility
   - Recency of information
   - Relevance to context

3. COMPARE
   - Create matrices
   - Weigh trade-offs
   - Consider edge cases
```

### Phase 4: Present Findings

```
1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
   - Key recommendation
   - Top 3 findings
   - Confidence level

2. DETAILED ANALYSIS
   - Full comparison
   - Supporting evidence
   - Caveats and limitations

3. ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Direct Task Assignment

```bash
@researcher "describe what you need done"
```

### Pattern 2: Chained with Other Agents

```bash
# Research first, then plan
@researcher "investigate best practices for X"
@researcher "create implementation plan based on research"
```

### Pattern 3: Within Team Mode

```bash
/team:run
# Sprint Master will automatically assign researcher to appropriate tasks
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent not responding as expected">
    Try being more specific in your task description. Include:
    - Clear success criteria
    - Relevant file paths
    - Expected output format
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Missing context from codebase">
    Run `/index` first to ensure the agent has full codebase awareness.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Agent taking too long">
    For complex tasks, break them down into smaller pieces or use `/mode token-efficient`.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
