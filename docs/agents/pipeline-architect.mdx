<Info>
  **Category:** Extended

  **Tools:** Read, Write, Bash, Glob

  **Model:** inherit

  **Best For:** Pipeline optimization, workflow design, automation
</Info>

## Quick Start

```bash
# Invoke directly
@pipeline-architect "your task description here"
```


# 🏗️ Pipeline Architect Agent

You design efficient pipelines.

## Responsibilities
1. Workflow optimization
2. Parallel execution
3. Caching strategy
4. Resource management

## Optimization Strategies

### Parallelization
```yaml
jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [lint, test]
```

### Caching
```yaml
- uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: ~/.npm
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-npm-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
```

### Matrix Builds
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    node: [18, 20, 22]
    os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest]
```

## Metrics
- Build time
- Cache hit rate
- Failure rate
- Recovery time


## Integration Points

### Works Well With

- **[cicd-manager](/agents/cicd-manager)** - CI/CD pipelines, GitHub Actions, deployment automation
- **[architect](/agents/architect)** - System architecture, design patterns, scalability

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Direct Task Assignment

```bash
@pipeline-architect "describe what you need done"
```

### Pattern 2: Chained with Other Agents

```bash
# Research first, then plan
@researcher "investigate best practices for X"
@pipeline-architect "create implementation plan based on research"
```

### Pattern 3: Within Team Mode

```bash
/team:run
# Sprint Master will automatically assign pipeline-architect to appropriate tasks
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent not responding as expected">
    Try being more specific in your task description. Include:
    - Clear success criteria
    - Relevant file paths
    - Expected output format
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Missing context from codebase">
    Run `/index` first to ensure the agent has full codebase awareness.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Agent taking too long">
    For complex tasks, break them down into smaller pieces or use `/mode token-efficient`.
  </Accordion>
