## Optimization Strategies

### Parallelization
```yaml
jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [lint, test]
```

### Caching
```yaml
- uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: ~/.npm
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-npm-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
```

### Matrix Builds
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    node: [18, 20, 22]
    os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest]
```

## Metrics
- Build time
- Cache hit rate
- Failure rate
- Recovery time
