## Using Agents

### Direct Invocation

The most straightforward way to use an agent:

```bash
# Syntax
@agent-name "your task description"

# Examples
@planner "plan the user authentication feature"
@tester "write tests for the PaymentService class"
@code-reviewer "review src/components/ for security issues"
@debugger "investigate why login fails on mobile"
```

### Via Commands

Many commands automatically route to the appropriate agent:

| Command | Agent | Use Case |
|---------|-------|----------|
| `/plan` | planner | Feature planning |
| `/test` | tester | Test generation |
| `/review` | code-reviewer | Code review |
| `/commit` | git-manager | Git commits |
| `/fix` | debugger | Bug fixing |
| `/research` | researcher | Technology research |
| `/brainstorm` | brainstormer | Ideation |

### In Team Mode

When running `/team:run`, the Sprint Master automatically:

1. Analyzes the sprint backlog
2. Decomposes tasks into agent assignments
3. Orchestrates parallel execution
4. Handles agent handoffs
5. Reports progress and blockers

```bash
# Start team mode
/team:run

# Check team status
/team:status

# Ask the team a question
/team:ask "what's blocking the auth feature?"
```

### Agent Chaining

Agents can be chained for complex workflows:

```bash
# Research → Plan → Implement → Test → Review
@researcher "investigate GraphQL best practices"
@planner "plan GraphQL API implementation"
@fullstack-developer "implement the planned GraphQL API"
@tester "write tests for the new GraphQL API"
@code-reviewer "review the GraphQL implementation"
```

## Agent Communication

Agents communicate through:

1. **Shared Context** - All agents see the same codebase and conversation
2. **Handoff Protocols** - Structured handoffs between agents
3. **Sprint Master** - Central orchestration in team mode
