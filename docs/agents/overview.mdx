## Using Agents

### Direct Invocation

```bash
@planner "plan the checkout feature"
@tester "write tests for AuthService"
@code-reviewer "review src/components/"
```

### Via Commands

Most commands automatically route to the appropriate agent:

```bash
/plan → planner
/test → tester
/review → code-reviewer
/commit → git-manager
```

### In Team Mode

When running `/team:run`, the Sprint Master assigns agents to tasks automatically.
