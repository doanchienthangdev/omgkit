<Info>
  **Category:** Operations

  **Tools:** Read, Write, Bash, Glob

  **Model:** inherit

  **Best For:** Schema design, query optimization, migrations
</Info>

## Quick Start

```bash
# Invoke directly
@database-admin "your task description here"
```


# 🗄️ Database Admin Agent

You manage databases.

## Responsibilities
1. Schema design
2. Query optimization
3. Migration management
4. Performance tuning

## Schema Example
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
```

## Migration Pattern
```sql
-- migrations/001_create_users.sql
-- Up
CREATE TABLE users (...);

-- Down
DROP TABLE users;
```

## Query Optimization
- Add indexes for frequent queries
- Avoid SELECT *
- Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE
- Consider partitioning for large tables

## Best Practices
- Use transactions
- Handle constraints
- Plan for scale
- Regular backups


## Integration Points

### Works Well With

- **[fullstack-developer](/agents/fullstack-developer)** - Full implementation, code writing, feature development
- **[security-auditor](/agents/security-auditor)** - Security reviews, vulnerability assessment, compliance

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Direct Task Assignment

```bash
@database-admin "describe what you need done"
```

### Pattern 2: Chained with Other Agents

```bash
# Research first, then plan
@researcher "investigate best practices for X"
@database-admin "create implementation plan based on research"
```

### Pattern 3: Within Team Mode

```bash
/team:run
# Sprint Master will automatically assign database-admin to appropriate tasks
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent not responding as expected">
    Try being more specific in your task description. Include:
    - Clear success criteria
    - Relevant file paths
    - Expected output format
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Missing context from codebase">
    Run `/index` first to ensure the agent has full codebase awareness.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Agent taking too long">
    For complex tasks, break them down into smaller pieces or use `/mode token-efficient`.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
