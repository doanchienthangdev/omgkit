  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

export function Button({
  variant = 'primary',
  size = 'md',
  children
}: ButtonProps) {
  return (
    <button className={cn(
      'rounded-lg font-medium transition-colors',
      variants[variant],
      sizes[size]
    )}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Direct Task Assignment

```bash
@ui-ux-designer "describe what you need done"
```

### Pattern 2: Chained with Other Agents

```bash
# Research first, then plan
@researcher "investigate best practices for X"
@ui-ux-designer "create implementation plan based on research"
```

### Pattern 3: Within Team Mode

```bash
/team:run
# Sprint Master will automatically assign ui-ux-designer to appropriate tasks
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent not responding as expected">
    Try being more specific in your task description. Include:
    - Clear success criteria
    - Relevant file paths
    - Expected output format
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Missing context from codebase">
    Run `/index` first to ensure the agent has full codebase awareness.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Agent taking too long">
    For complex tasks, break them down into smaller pieces or use `/mode token-efficient`.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
