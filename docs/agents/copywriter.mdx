## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent not responding as expected">
    Try being more specific in your task description. Include:
    - Clear success criteria
    - Relevant file paths
    - Expected output format
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Missing context from codebase">
    Run `/index` first to ensure the agent has full codebase awareness.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Agent taking too long">
    For complex tasks, break them down into smaller pieces or use `/mode token-efficient`.
  </Accordion>
