# Feature Development Workflow

## Overview

The Feature Development workflow guides you through implementing a complete feature from initial planning to deployment-ready code. It orchestrates multiple agents to ensure high-quality, well-tested, and properly reviewed code.

## When to Use

- Building new functionality
- Adding significant enhancements
- Implementing user stories
- Creating new modules or components

## Steps

### Step 1: Planning
**Agent:** planner
**Command:** `/planning:plan "$ARGUMENTS"`
**Duration:** 15-30 minutes

The planner agent will:
- Analyze feature requirements
- Break down into implementable tasks
- Create detailed implementation plan
- Define acceptance criteria
- Identify dependencies and risks

**Output:** Implementation plan in `.omgkit/plans/`

### Step 2: Implementation
**Agent:** fullstack-developer
**Command:** `/dev:feature "$ARGUMENTS"`
**Duration:** 1-4 hours

The fullstack developer will:
- Follow the implementation plan
- Write code incrementally
- Add inline documentation
- Follow coding standards
- Create necessary files and components

**Output:** Feature code implemented

### Step 3: Testing
**Agent:** tester
**Command:** `/dev:test`
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes

The tester agent will:
- Write unit tests for new code
- Write integration tests
- Achieve coverage target (>80%)
- Run all tests and fix failures

**Output:** Test suite with passing tests

### Step 4: Code Review
**Agent:** code-reviewer
**Command:** `/dev:review`
**Duration:** 15-30 minutes

The code reviewer will:
- Review code quality
- Check for security issues
- Verify best practices
- Suggest improvements
- Ensure maintainability

**Output:** Review comments and fixes

### Step 5: Commit & PR
**Agent:** git-manager
**Command:** `/git:pr "feature/$BRANCH_NAME"`
**Duration:** 10-15 minutes

The git manager will:
- Create feature branch
- Stage and commit changes
- Write meaningful commit message
- Create pull request
- Add PR description

**Output:** Pull request ready for merge

## Quality Gates

```

## Tips

- Start with a clear, concise feature description
- Include specific requirements and constraints
- Reference any design documents or mockups
- Specify the target completion timeframe
- Include any dependencies on other features

## Testing Options

This workflow respects project testing configuration from `.omgkit/workflow.yaml`.

### Command Options

| Option | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--no-test` | Skip test enforcement | `/dev:feature "login" --no-test` |
| `--test-level <level>` | Override enforcement level | `/dev:feature "auth" --test-level strict` |
| `--coverage <percent>` | Override coverage minimum | `/dev:feature "api" --coverage 95` |

### Configuration

```yaml
# .omgkit/workflow.yaml
testing:
  enabled: true
  enforcement:
    level: standard  # soft | standard | strict
  coverage_gates:
    unit:
      minimum: 80
```

### CLI Configuration

```bash
# Set enforcement level
omgkit config set testing.enforcement.level strict

# View testing config
omgkit config list testing
```

## Example Usage

```bash
# Full feature workflow with default testing
/workflow:feature "user authentication with OAuth2 support"

# With strict test enforcement
/dev:feature "payment processing" --test-level strict

# With specific coverage requirement
/dev:feature "shopping cart" --coverage 95

# Skip testing for prototype (soft level required)
/dev:feature "quick prototype" --no-test
```
