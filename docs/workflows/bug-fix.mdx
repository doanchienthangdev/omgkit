# Bug Fix Workflow

## Overview

The Bug Fix workflow provides a systematic approach to debugging and resolving issues. It ensures that bugs are properly investigated, fixed with minimal changes, and verified with regression tests.

## When to Use

- Fixing reported bugs
- Resolving error messages
- Addressing unexpected behavior
- Fixing failing tests
- Resolving production issues

## Steps

### Step 1: Investigation
**Agent:** debugger
**Command:** `/dev:fix "$ARGUMENTS"`
**Duration:** 15-60 minutes

The debugger agent will:
- Reproduce the issue
- Analyze error messages and stack traces
- Form hypotheses about root cause
- Test each hypothesis systematically
- Identify the actual root cause

**Output:** Root cause analysis

### Step 2: Implementation
**Agent:** fullstack-developer
**Command:** `/dev:fix-hard` (if needed)
**Duration:** 15-120 minutes

The fullstack developer will:
- Implement minimal fix
- Avoid introducing regressions
- Update related code if necessary
- Add defensive coding where appropriate

**Output:** Bug fix implementation

### Step 3: Verification
**Agent:** tester
**Command:** `/dev:fix-test`
**Duration:** 15-30 minutes

The tester agent will:
- Write regression test for the bug
- Run existing test suite
- Verify fix works in all scenarios
- Check for side effects

**Output:** Regression test and verification

### Step 4: Commit
**Agent:** git-manager
**Command:** `/git:cm`
**Duration:** 5-10 minutes

The git manager will:
- Commit fix with descriptive message
- Reference issue number
- Update changelog if needed

**Output:** Committed fix

## Quality Gates

- [ ] Root cause clearly identified and documented
- [ ] Fix is minimal and focused
- [ ] Regression test added
- [ ] All existing tests still pass
- [ ] No new issues introduced
- [ ] Fix committed with proper message

## Debug Process

```
Bug Fix Debug Process
=====================
1. REPRODUCE
   - Get exact steps to reproduce
   - Identify environment/conditions
   - Confirm bug is consistent

2. HYPOTHESIZE
   - Form 3-5 possible causes
   - Rank by likelihood
   - Plan how to test each

3. INVESTIGATE
   - Test most likely hypothesis first
   - Use debugging tools/logs
   - Narrow down to specific code

4. FIX
   - Implement minimal change
   - Consider edge cases
   - Document the fix

5. VERIFY
   - Test the fix works
   - Run regression tests
   - Check related functionality
```

## Tips

- Include the exact error message when describing the bug
- Provide steps to reproduce if known
- Include relevant log output
- Specify the environment (browser, OS, version)
- Link to related issues or discussions

## Example Usage

```bash
# Fix with error description
/workflow:bug-fix "TypeError: Cannot read property 'id' of undefined in UserService"

# Fix with context
/workflow:bug-fix "Login button not responding after page refresh"

# Fix with issue reference
/workflow:bug-fix "Issue #123: Payment processing fails for amounts > $1000"
```
