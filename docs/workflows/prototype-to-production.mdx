```


# Prototype to Production Workflow

Convert rapid game prototype into maintainable production code.

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Working prototype with core mechanics
- [ ] Game design document
- [ ] Target platforms defined

## Phase 1: Prototype Assessment

### Step 1.1: Evaluate Prototype
```yaml
agent: game-systems-designer
action: assess
evaluation:
  - Core mechanics working
  - Fun factor validated
  - Technical feasibility
  - Performance baseline
  - Technical debt inventory
```

### Step 1.2: Define Production Requirements
```yaml
agent: game-systems-designer
action: define
requirements:
  - Target frame rate: 60fps
  - Memory budget: <2GB
  - Load time: <10s
  - Platform requirements
  - Accessibility features
```

## Phase 2: Architecture Refactoring

### Step 2.1: Design Production Architecture
```yaml
agent: game-systems-designer
action: design
patterns:
  - Component system (ECS or composition)
  - State machine for game states
  - Event system for decoupling
  - Object pooling for performance
  - Asset management system
```

### Step 2.2: Create Core Systems
```yaml
agent: fullstack-developer
action: implement
systems:
  - Game loop manager
  - Scene management
  - Input handling
  - Audio manager
  - Save/load system
  - UI framework
```

## Phase 3: Code Migration

### Step 3.1: Extract Reusable Components
```yaml
agent: fullstack-developer
action: refactor
from_prototype:
  - Identify reusable code
  - Extract to components
  - Add proper interfaces
  - Remove hardcoding
  - Add configuration
```

### Step 3.2: Implement Production Code
```yaml
agent: fullstack-developer
action: implement
standards:
  - Clean code principles
  - SOLID for game code
  - Proper error handling
  - Logging and debugging
  - Performance considerations
```

## Phase 4: Asset Pipeline

### Step 4.1: Setup Asset Pipeline
```yaml
agent: fullstack-developer
action: configure
pipeline:
  - Asset import settings
  - Compression configuration
  - LOD generation
  - Texture atlasing
  - Audio compression
  - Localization support
```

### Step 4.2: Asset Organization
```yaml
agent: fullstack-developer
action: organize
structure:
  - /Assets
    - /Art
    - /Audio
    - /Prefabs
    - /Scripts
    - /Scenes
    - /UI
  - Naming conventions
  - Folder structure guidelines
```

## Phase 5: Testing Infrastructure

### Step 5.1: Unit Testing
```yaml
agent: tester
action: implement
tests:
  - Core mechanics
  - State machines
  - Calculations
  - Utility functions
  - Data validation
```

### Step 5.2: Integration Testing
```yaml
agent: tester
action: implement
tests:
  - Scene loading
  - Save/load cycle
  - Input handling
  - Audio playback
  - UI navigation
```

### Step 5.3: Playtest Framework
```yaml
agent: tester
action: configure
framework:
  - Automated playthroughs
  - Metrics collection
  - Bug reproduction
  - Performance profiling
```

## Phase 6: Performance Optimization

### Step 6.1: Profile and Optimize
```yaml
agent: fullstack-developer
action: optimize
areas:
  - Draw call batching
  - Object pooling
  - Memory management
  - Physics optimization
  - Script optimization
```

### Step 6.2: Platform Optimization
```yaml
agent: fullstack-developer
action: optimize
per_platform:
  - PC settings
  - Console optimizations
  - Mobile considerations
  - Quality settings system
```

## Outputs
- [ ] Production architecture
- [ ] Refactored codebase
- [ ] Asset pipeline
- [ ] Test suite
- [ ] Performance profile

## Quality Gates
- 60fps on target hardware
- Memory within budget
- All tests passing
- No critical bugs
- Code review passed
