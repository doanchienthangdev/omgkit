# 100x Architecture Workflow

## Overview

The 100x Architecture workflow helps design and plan systems capable of scaling 100x from current capacity. It applies Omega thinking to architecture decisions.

## When to Use

- Planning for major growth
- Redesigning bottlenecked systems
- Preparing for scale
- Modernizing architecture

## Steps

### Step 1: Current State Analysis
**Agent:** oracle
**Command:** `/omega:100x "$ARGUMENTS"`
**Duration:** 1-2 hours

Analyze current architecture:
- Map system components
- Identify bottlenecks
- Measure current capacity
- Document constraints

**Output:** Architecture analysis

### Step 2: Bottleneck Identification
**Agent:** architect
**Duration:** 1-2 hours

Find scaling limits:
- Database bottlenecks
- Compute limitations
- Network constraints
- Storage limits

**Output:** Bottleneck report

### Step 3: Future State Design
**Agent:** architect
**Duration:** 2-4 hours

Design scalable architecture:
- Apply scaling patterns
- Design for 100x capacity
- Plan data partitioning
- Design service boundaries

**Output:** Future architecture

### Step 4: Migration Planning
**Agent:** planner
**Command:** `/planning:plan-detailed "migration"`
**Duration:** 2-4 hours

Plan migration:
- Phased approach
- Risk mitigation
- Rollback strategy
- Timeline

**Output:** Migration plan

### Step 5: Validation
**Agent:** researcher
**Duration:** 1-2 hours

Validate design:
- Review against requirements
- Check industry patterns
- Assess feasibility
- Identify risks

**Output:** Validation report

## Quality Gates

- [ ] Current architecture documented
