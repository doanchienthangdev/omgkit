# Penetration Testing Workflow

## Overview

The Penetration Testing workflow simulates attacks to identify security weaknesses. It follows ethical hacking methodology with proper authorization.

## When to Use

- Compliance requirements
- Pre-production security validation
- Third-party security assessment
- After major architecture changes

## Steps

### Step 1: Scope Definition
**Agent:** security-auditor
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes

Define scope:
- Target systems
- Test boundaries
- Excluded areas
- Rules of engagement

**Output:** Scope document

### Step 2: Reconnaissance
**Agent:** vulnerability-scanner
**Duration:** 1-2 hours

Information gathering:
- Network mapping
- Service enumeration
- Technology fingerprinting
- Exposed endpoints

**Output:** Reconnaissance report

### Step 3: Vulnerability Analysis
**Agent:** vulnerability-scanner
**Command:** `/quality:security-scan`
**Duration:** 1-2 hours

Identify vulnerabilities:
- Automated scanning
- Manual probing
- Configuration review
- Authentication testing

**Output:** Vulnerability list

### Step 4: Exploitation
**Agent:** security-auditor
**Duration:** 2-4 hours

Attempt exploitation:
- Proof of concept attacks
- Privilege escalation
- Data access attempts
- Chained exploits

**Output:** Exploitation results

### Step 5: Post-Exploitation
**Agent:** security-auditor
**Duration:** 1-2 hours

Assess impact:
- Access level achieved
- Data exposure potential
- Lateral movement
- Persistence options

**Output:** Impact assessment

### Step 6: Reporting
**Agent:** security-auditor
**Duration:** 1-2 hours

Generate report:
- Executive summary
- Technical details
- Risk ratings
- Remediation guidance

**Output:** Penetration test report

## Quality Gates
