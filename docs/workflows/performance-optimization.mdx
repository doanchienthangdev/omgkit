# Performance Optimization Workflow

## Overview

The Performance Optimization workflow systematically improves application performance through profiling, optimization, and measurement.

## When to Use

- Slow application response
- High resource usage
- Scaling preparation
- Cost optimization

## Steps

### Step 1: Profiling
**Agent:** fullstack-developer
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes

Profile performance:
- Identify bottlenecks
- Measure baselines
- CPU/memory analysis
- Network profiling

**Output:** Performance profile

### Step 2: Analysis
**Agent:** fullstack-developer
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes

Analyze bottlenecks:
- Root cause analysis
- Impact assessment
- Prioritization
- Solution options

**Output:** Analysis report

### Step 3: Optimization
**Agent:** fullstack-developer
**Command:** `/quality:optimize "$ARGUMENTS"`
**Duration:** 1-4 hours

Implement optimizations:
- Code optimizations
- Caching strategies
- Query optimization
- Resource management

**Output:** Optimized code

### Step 4: Measurement
**Agent:** tester
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes

Measure improvements:
- Run benchmarks
- Compare to baseline
- Verify no regressions
- Document results

**Output:** Performance report

### Step 5: Validation
**Agent:** tester
**Command:** `/dev:test`
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes

Validate changes:
- Run test suite
- Integration tests
- Load tests
- Smoke tests

**Output:** Validation report
