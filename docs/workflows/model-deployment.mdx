```


# Model Deployment Workflow

Deploy models safely to production environments.

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Model trained and validated
- [ ] Serving infrastructure ready
- [ ] Monitoring configured

## Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Validation

### Step 1.1: Model Validation
```yaml
agent: ml-engineer
action: validate
checks:
  - Performance on holdout set
  - Performance on recent data
  - Bias and fairness metrics
  - Edge case handling
comparison:
  - vs current production model
  - vs baseline
```

### Step 1.2: Technical Validation
```yaml
agent: ml-engineer
action: validate
checks:
  - Model loads correctly
  - Input/output schema correct
  - Inference latency acceptable
  - Memory footprint acceptable
  - Batch inference works
```

## Phase 2: Model Packaging

### Step 2.1: Export Model
```yaml
agent: ml-engineer
action: export
formats:
  - ONNX (portable)
  - SavedModel (TensorFlow)
  - TorchScript (PyTorch)
  - Pickle (sklearn)
  - MLflow Model format
```

### Step 2.2: Create Serving Container
```yaml
agent: ml-engineer
action: containerize
components:
  - Model artifacts
  - Inference code
  - Dependencies
  - Health checks
  - Metrics endpoint
base_images:
  - tensorflow/serving
  - pytorch/torchserve
  - Custom Python
```

## Phase 3: Staging Deployment

### Step 3.1: Deploy to Staging
```yaml
agent: observability-engineer
action: deploy
environment: staging
infrastructure:
  - Kubernetes deployment
  - Auto-scaling config
  - Resource limits
  - Health probes
```

### Step 3.2: Integration Testing
```yaml
agent: ml-engineer
action: test
tests:
  - End-to-end inference
  - Load testing
  - Error handling
  - Timeout behavior
  - Batch processing
```

## Phase 4: Production Deployment

### Step 4.1: Canary Deployment
```yaml
agent: observability-engineer
action: deploy
strategy: canary
configuration:
  initial_traffic: 5%
  increment: 10%
  evaluation_period: 30m
  rollback_threshold:
    error_rate: 1%
    latency_p99: 500ms
```

### Step 4.2: Shadow Deployment (Optional)
```yaml
agent: observability-engineer
action: deploy
strategy: shadow
configuration:
  - Mirror production traffic
  - Compare predictions
  - No impact on production
  - Log discrepancies
```

### Step 4.3: Full Rollout
```yaml
agent: observability-engineer
action: promote
after:
  - Canary success
  - No anomalies detected
  - Stakeholder approval
steps:
  - Increase traffic gradually
  - Monitor metrics
  - Keep rollback ready
```

## Phase 5: Post-Deployment

### Step 5.1: Configure Monitoring
```yaml
agent: observability-engineer
action: configure
monitoring:
  - Prediction latency
  - Throughput
  - Error rates
  - Model-specific metrics
  - Resource usage
dashboards:
  - Real-time metrics
  - Prediction distribution
  - Feature drift
```

### Step 5.2: Configure Alerts
```yaml
agent: observability-engineer
action: configure
alerts:
  - High error rate
  - Latency degradation
  - Model drift detected
  - Resource exhaustion
  - Prediction anomalies
```

### Step 5.3: Update Model Registry
```yaml
agent: ml-engineer
action: update
registry:
  - Mark as production
  - Update version info
  - Link to deployment
  - Document changes
```

## Outputs
- [ ] Packaged model
- [ ] Serving container
- [ ] Deployment configuration
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Runbook

## Quality Gates
- Staging tests pass
- Canary metrics acceptable
- No prediction drift
- Latency within SLA
- Rollback tested
