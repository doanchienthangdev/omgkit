# Best Practices Discovery Workflow

## Overview

The Best Practices workflow helps discover, evaluate, and adopt industry best practices for specific areas of development.

## When to Use

- Improving code quality
- Adopting industry standards
- Team skill development
- Process improvement

## Steps

### Step 1: Area Definition
**Agent:** researcher
**Duration:** 15-30 minutes

Define area:
- Specific domain
- Current state
- Improvement goals
- Success criteria

**Output:** Focus area

### Step 2: Research
**Agent:** researcher
**Command:** `/planning:research`
**Duration:** 1-2 hours

Research practices:
- Industry standards
- Expert opinions
- Case studies
- Framework guidelines

**Output:** Best practices list

### Step 3: Gap Analysis
**Agent:** researcher
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes

Analyze gaps:
- Current vs ideal
- Priority areas
- Quick wins
- Long-term goals

**Output:** Gap analysis

### Step 4: Adoption Plan
**Agent:** planner
**Command:** `/planning:plan`
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes

Plan adoption:
- Prioritized changes
- Implementation steps
- Training needs
- Timeline

**Output:** Adoption plan

### Step 5: Implementation
**Agent:** fullstack-developer
**Duration:** 1-4 hours

Implement changes:
- Apply practices
- Update code
- Add tooling
- Document changes

**Output:** Practices adopted
