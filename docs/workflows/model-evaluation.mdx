# Model Evaluation Workflow

## Overview

The Model Evaluation workflow provides a systematic approach to evaluating AI model performance. It covers defining metrics, creating evaluation datasets, running evaluations, and generating comprehensive reports.

## When to Use

- Comparing model options
- Validating model performance
- Regression testing after changes
- A/B testing model versions
- Compliance and audit requirements

## Steps

### Step 1: Strategy Definition
**Agent:** planner
**Command:** `/planning:plan "evaluation strategy"`
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes

Define strategy:
- Identify evaluation goals
- Select evaluation dimensions
- Define success criteria
- Plan evaluation scope

**Output:** Evaluation strategy document

### Step 2: Metrics Selection
**Agent:** researcher
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes

Select metrics:
- Task-specific metrics (accuracy, F1, BLEU, etc.)
- Quality metrics (coherence, relevance)
- Safety metrics (toxicity, bias)
- Performance metrics (latency, cost)

**Output:** Metrics specification

### Step 3: Dataset Creation
**Agent:** fullstack-developer
**Duration:** 1-4 hours

Create evaluation dataset:
- Collect/generate test cases
- Create golden answers
- Include edge cases
- Balance dataset distribution

**Output:** Evaluation dataset

### Step 4: Evaluation Execution
**Agent:** tester
**Command:** `/dev:test`
**Duration:** 1-4 hours

Run evaluations:
- Execute test suite
- Collect results
- Handle errors gracefully
- Track all metrics

**Output:** Raw evaluation results

### Step 5: Analysis
**Agent:** researcher
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes

Analyze results:
- Statistical analysis
- Error analysis
- Performance breakdown
- Comparison with baselines

**Output:** Analysis report

### Step 6: Report Generation
**Agent:** researcher
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes

Generate report:
- Executive summary
- Detailed metrics
- Recommendations
- Visual dashboards

**Output:** Evaluation report

## Quality Gates

- [ ] Evaluation strategy approved
- [ ] Metrics align with goals
- [ ] Dataset is representative

- BERTScore: Semantic similarity

QUALITY METRICS:
- Coherence: Logical consistency
- Relevance: Answer pertinence
- Completeness: Coverage of topic
- Factuality: Correctness of facts

SAFETY METRICS:
- Toxicity: Harmful content
- Bias: Unfair outputs
- Hallucination: Made-up facts
- Prompt Injection: Security

PERFORMANCE METRICS:
- Latency: Response time
- Throughput: Requests/second
- Cost: $ per request
- Token Usage: Efficiency
```

## Report Template

```markdown

## Executive Summary
- Model: [name]
- Evaluation Date: [date]
- Overall Score: [X/100]
- Recommendation: [Pass/Fail/Conditional]

## Metrics Summary
| Metric | Score | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Accuracy | X% | Y% | Pass |
| Latency | Xms | Yms | Pass |

## Tips

- Use diverse test cases
- Include adversarial examples
- Compare with baselines
- Document methodology
- Version control datasets

## Example Usage

```bash
# Evaluate chat model
/workflow:model-evaluation "GPT-4 for customer support with accuracy and safety metrics"

# Compare models
/workflow:model-evaluation "Claude vs GPT-4 for code generation tasks"

# Regression testing
/workflow:model-evaluation "fine-tuned model v2 vs v1 performance comparison"
```
