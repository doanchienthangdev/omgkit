# Code Review Workflow

## Overview

The Code Review workflow provides thorough code review with actionable feedback and improvement implementation.

## When to Use

- Before merging PRs
- After feature completion
- For code quality improvement
- Learning from code

## Steps

### Step 1: Review
**Agent:** code-reviewer
**Command:** `/dev:review`
**Duration:** 15-45 minutes

Review code:
- Architecture review
- Code quality check
- Security analysis
- Performance review
- Best practices

**Output:** Review comments

### Step 2: Fix Issues
**Agent:** fullstack-developer
**Command:** `/dev:fix`
**Duration:** 15-60 minutes

Address feedback:
- Implement fixes
- Improve code
- Update tests
- Refactor as needed

**Output:** Improved code

### Step 3: Commit
**Agent:** git-manager
**Command:** `/git:commit`
**Duration:** 5-10 minutes

Commit changes:
- Stage changes
- Write message
- Create commit

**Output:** Changes committed
