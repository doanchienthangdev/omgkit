## How Workflows Work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Invoke Workflow">
    Run a workflow with `/workflow:<name> "description"`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Agent Orchestration">
    The workflow coordinates multiple specialized agents
  </Step>
  <Step title="Quality Gates">
    Each step has quality checkpoints to ensure standards
  </Step>
  <Step title="Completion">
    Workflow completes with documented outcomes
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example: Feature Development

```bash
# Start the feature workflow
/workflow:feature "user authentication with OAuth2"

# The workflow will:
# 1. Planning (planner agent)
# 2. Implementation (fullstack-developer agent)
# 3. Testing (tester agent)
# 4. Code Review (code-reviewer agent)
# 5. Commit & PR (git-manager agent)
```

## Workflow Patterns

### Sequential Workflows

Run workflows one after another for comprehensive processes:

```bash
# Research → Plan → Build
/workflow:best-practices "authentication patterns"
/workflow:feature "implement auth based on research"
```

### Category-Specific Patterns

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Development">
```bash
# Feature lifecycle
/workflow:feature "new dashboard"
/workflow:refactor "optimize dashboard queries"
/workflow:code-review "dashboard components"
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="AI Engineering">
```bash
# RAG development lifecycle
/workflow:rag-development "knowledge base Q&A"
/workflow:model-evaluation "evaluate RAG performance"
/workflow:prompt-engineering "optimize retrieval prompts"
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Sprint">
```bash
# Sprint lifecycle
/workflow:sprint-setup "Q1 Sprint 1"
/workflow:sprint-execution
/workflow:sprint-retrospective
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Quality Gates

Every workflow includes quality gates that ensure:

<Check>Code meets project standards</Check>
<Check>Tests pass with adequate coverage</Check>
<Check>Security vulnerabilities addressed</Check>
<Check>Documentation updated</Check>
<Check>Review completed</Check>
