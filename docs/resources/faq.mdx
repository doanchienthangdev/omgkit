## General

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is OMGKIT?">
    OMGKIT (Omega-Level Development Kit) is a plugin for Claude Code that transforms it into an autonomous AI development team. It includes 23 specialized agents, 54 commands, 43 skills, and 9 behavioral modes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is OMGKIT free?">
    Yes, OMGKIT is open source and free to use under the MIT license. You need a Claude Code subscription to use it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between OMGKIT and vanilla Claude Code?">
    Claude Code is a powerful AI coding assistant. OMGKIT adds:
    - **Specialized agents** instead of one general AI
    - **Sprint management** for organized development
    - **Omega thinking** for 10x-1000x solutions
    - **Modes** for different development contexts
    - **Skills** for deep domain expertise
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does OMGKIT work with other AI assistants?">
    Currently, OMGKIT is designed specifically for Claude Code. Support for other AI assistants may be added in the future.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Installation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What are the requirements?">
    - Node.js 18 or higher
    - Claude Code installed and working
    - npm, yarn, or pnpm
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Where is the plugin installed?">
    The plugin is installed to `~/.claude/plugins/omgkit/`. Your project-specific configuration goes in `.omgkit/` within your project.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I update OMGKIT?">
    ```bash
    npm update -g omgkit
    omgkit install  # Reinstall plugin
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I uninstall OMGKIT?">
    ```bash
    omgkit uninstall  # Remove plugin
    npm uninstall -g omgkit  # Remove CLI
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Usage

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I start using OMGKIT?">
    1. Install: `npm install -g omgkit`
    2. Install plugin: `omgkit install`
    3. Initialize project: `cd your-project && omgkit init`
    4. Start using commands: `/feature "add login"`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between /feature and /fix?">
    - `/feature` is for building new functionality. It uses the full workflow: plan → implement → test → review → commit.
    - `/fix` is for debugging and fixing bugs. It focuses on finding and resolving issues.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When should I use sprint management vs. single commands?">
    - **Single commands** (`/feature`, `/fix`): Quick, one-off tasks
    - **Sprint management** (`/sprint:new`, `/team:run`): Larger projects with multiple features, when you want organized development
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What does /team:run --mode=full-auto actually do?">
    In full-auto mode, the AI team works autonomously:
    1. Sprint Master picks up the next task
    2. Assigns to appropriate agent(s)
    3. Agent completes the task
    4. Results are reviewed and committed
    5. Moves to next task
    6. Repeats until sprint is complete
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Agents

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I create custom agents?">
    Not yet, but this is planned for a future release. Currently, you can customize existing agents through configuration.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I invoke a specific agent?">
    Use the `@` prefix:
    ```bash
    @planner "plan the checkout flow"
    @tester "write tests for UserService"
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can agents work in parallel?">
    Yes, in `/team:run` mode, independent tasks can be executed by different agents in parallel. The Sprint Master coordinates this.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Omega

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Omega thinking?">
    Omega thinking is a mental framework that pushes you to think beyond incremental improvements. Instead of 10% better, aim for 10x, 100x, or even 1000x better.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are the 7 Omega Principles?">
    1. Leverage Multiplication - Build systems, not features
    2. Transcendent Abstraction - Solve classes, not instances
    3. Agentic Decomposition - Orchestrate specialists
    4. Feedback Acceleration - Compress feedback loops
    5. Zero-Marginal-Cost Scaling - Build once, scale infinitely
    6. Emergent Intelligence - System greater than parts
    7. Aesthetic Perfection - Excellence in everything
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I use /10x, /100x, /1000x?">
    These commands invoke the Oracle agent to analyze a topic through the lens of Omega thinking:
    ```bash
    /10x "our deployment process"    # Find 10x improvements
    /100x "our testing strategy"     # Find paradigm shifts
    /1000x "our entire product"      # Moonshot thinking
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Commands not working in Claude Code">
    1. Run `omgkit doctor` to check installation
    2. Restart Claude Code
    3. Verify plugin exists at `~/.claude/plugins/omgkit/`
    4. Re-run `omgkit install`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="'omgkit' command not found">
    Add npm global bin to your PATH:
    ```bash
    export PATH="$PATH:$(npm config get prefix)/bin"
    ```
    Add this to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Agents not handoff correctly">
    Check your `.omgkit/config.yaml`:
    ```yaml
    agents:
      auto_handoff: true
    ```
    If still not working, try `/mode orchestration` for explicit coordination.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tests failing in CI but passing locally">
    Ensure your CI environment matches local:
    - Same Node.js version
    - Same dependencies (`npm ci` not `npm install`)
    - Same environment variables
  </Accordion>
